{"name": "3554", "description": "Zonk is addictive dice game. In each round player rolls 6 dice. Then (s)he composes combinations from them. Each combination gives certain points. \n\nThen player can take one or more dice combinations to his hand and re-roll remaining dice or save his score. Dice in player's hand won't be taken into account in subsequent rolls.\n\nIf no combinations can be composed - situation is called \"zonk\". Player thrown zonk loses all points in this round and next player moves. So it's player decision when to reroll and when to stop and save his score.\n\nYour task is simple - just evaluate current roll and return maximum number of points can be scored from it. If no combinations can be made - function must return string ``\"Zonk\"`` (without quotes).\n\nThere are different variations of Zonk. In this kata, we will use most common table of combinations:\n\nCombinationExample rollPoints\nStraight (1,2,3,4,5 and 6)6 3 1 2 5 41000 points\nThree pairs of any dice2 2 4 4 1 1750 points\nThree of 11 4 1 11000 points\nThree of 22 3 4 2 2200 points\nThree of 33 4 3 6 3 2300 points\nThree of 44 4 4400 points\nThree of 52 5 5 5 4500 points\nThree of 66 6 2 6600 points\nFour of a kind1 1 1 1 4 62 \u00d7 Three-of-a-kind score (in example, 2000 pts)\nFive of a kind5 5 5 4 5 53 \u00d7 Three-of-a-kind score (in example, 1500 pts)\nSix of a kind4 4 4 4 4 44 \u00d7 Three-of-a-kind score (in example, 1600 pts)\nEvery 14 3 1 2 2100 points\nEvery 55 2 650 points\n\n\nEach die cannot be used in multiple combinations the same time, so three pairs of 2, 3 and 5 will worth you only ``750`` points (for three pairs), not 850 (for three pairs and two fives). But you can select multiple combinations, ``2 2 2 1 6`` will worth you ``300`` points (200 for three-of-kind '2' plus 100 for single '1' die)\n\nExamples:\n```python\n  get_score([1,2,3]) # returns 100 = points from one 1\n  get_score([3,4,1,1,5]) # returns 250 = points from two 1 and one 5\n  get_score([2,3,2,3,3,2]) # returns 500 = three of 2 + three of 3\n  get_score([1,1,1,1,1,5]) # returns 3050 = five 1 + one 5\n  get_score([2,3,4,3,6,6]) # returns \"Zonk\" = no combinations here\n  get_score([2,2,6,6,2,2]) # returns 400 = four 2, this cannot be scored as three pairs\n  get_score([1,3,4,3,4,1]) # returns 750 = three pairs\n  get_score([3,3,3,3]) # returns 600 = four of 3\n  get_score([1,2,3,4,5]) # returns 150 = it's not straight\n```\nOf course, in real Zonk game it's sometimes not worth to collect all combination from roll. Taking less dice and rerolling more remaining may be better, but task is just to calculate maximum possible score from current single roll.\n\nP.S.

{"name": "3478", "description": "Magic The Gathering is a collectible card game that features wizards battling against each other with spells and creature summons. The game itself can be quite complicated to learn. In this series of katas, we'll be solving some of the situations that arise during gameplay. You won't need any prior knowledge of the game to solve these contrived problems, as I will provide you with enough information.\n\n## Creatures\n\nEach creature has a power and toughness. We will represent this in an array. [2, 3] means this creature has a power of 2 and a toughness of 3.\n\nWhen two creatures square off, they each deal damage equal to their power to each other at the same time. If a creature takes on damage greater than or equal to their toughness, they die.\n\nExamples:\n\n- Creature 1 - [2, 3]\n- Creature 2 - [3, 3]\n- Creature 3 - [1, 4]\n- Creature 4 - [4, 1]\n\nIf creature 1 battles creature 2, creature 1 dies, while 2 survives. If creature 3 battles creature 4, they both die, as 3 deals 1 damage to 4, but creature 4 only has a toughness of 1.\n\nWrite a function `battle(player1, player2)` that takes in 2 arrays of creatures. Each players' creatures battle each other in order (player1[0] battles the creature in player2[0]) and so on. If one list of creatures is longer than the other, those creatures are considered unblocked, and do not battle.\n\nYour function should return an object (a hash in Ruby) with the keys player1 and player2 that contain the power and toughness of the surviving creatures.\n\nExample:\n```\nGood luck with your battles!\n\n\nCheck out my other Magic The Gathering katas:\n\n\nMagic The Gathering #1: Creatures\nMagic The Gathering #2: Mana", "difficulty": "introductory", "id": 3478, "sample_io": [{"input": "[[2, 3], [1, 4]]\n[[3, 3], [4, 1]]", "output": [{"player1": [], "player2": [[3, 3]]}]}, {"input": "[]\n[]", "output": [{"player1": [], "player2": []}]}], "test_list": [{"input": "[[2, 3], [1, 4]]\n[[3, 3], [4, 1]]", "output": [{"player1": [], "player2": [[3, 3]]}]}, {"input": "[]\n[]", "output": [{"player1": [], "player2": []}]}, {"input": "[[1, 1]]\n[[1, 1]]", "output": [{"player1": [], "player2": []}]}, {"input": "[[2, 1]]\n[[2, 1]]", "output": [{"player1": [], "player2": []}]}, {"input": "[[1, 2]]\n[[1, 2]]", "output": [{"player1": [[1, 2]], "player2": [[1, 2]]}]}, {"input": "[[2, 3]]\n[[3, 2]]", "output": [{"player1": [], "player2": []}]}, {"input": "[[2, 7]]\n[[3, 5]]", "output": [{"player1": [[2, 7]], "player2": [[3, 5]]}]}, {"input": "[[2, 5]]\n[[6, 6]]", "output": [{"player1": [], "player2": [[6, 6]]}]}, {"input": "[[6, 6]]\n[[2, 5]]", "output": [{"player1": [[6, 6]], "player2": []}]}, {"input": "[]\n[[1, 1], [2, 2]]", "output": [{"player1": [], "player2": [[1, 1], [2, 2]]}]}, {"input": "[[1, 1], [2, 2]]\n[]", "output": [{"player1": [[1, 1], [2, 2]], "player2": []}]}, {"input": "[[1, 3], [3, 5], [4, 6], [5, 2]]\n[[2, 4], [6, 1], [4, 4], [3, 7], [3, 1]]", "output": [{"player1": [[1, 3], [4, 6]], "player2": [[2, 4], [3, 7], [3, 1]]}]}], "starter_code": "\ndef battle(player1, player2):\n\t", "source_codes": ["\ndef battle(player1, player2):\n    # Initialize the result dictionary with empty lists for both players\n    result = {'player1': [], 'player2': []}\n    \n    # Iterate over the creatures of both players\n    for p1_creature, p2_creature in zip(player1, player2):\n        # Calculate the remaining toughness after the battle\n        p1_toughness_left = p1_creature[1] - p2_creature[0]\n        p2_toughness_left = p2_creature[1] - p1_creature[0]\n        \n        # If player 1's creature survives, add it to the result\n        if p1_toughness_left > 0:\n            result['player1'].append([p1_creature[0], p1_toughness_left])\n        # If player 2's creature survives, add it to the result\n        if p2_toughness_left > 0:\n            result['player2'].append([p2_creature[0], p2_toughness_left])\n    \n    # Add any unblocked creatures to the result\n    if len(player1) > len(player2):\n        result['player1'].extend(player1[len(player2):])\n    elif len(player2) > len(player1):\n        result['player2'].extend(player2[len(player1):])\n    \n    return result\n\n# Take input for player1 and player2 creatures\nplayer1_creatures = eval(input())\nplayer2_creatures = eval(input())\n\n# Call the battle function and print the result\nbattle_result = battle(player1_creatures, player2_creatures)\nprint(battle_result)\n\n\n"], "responses": ["```python\ndef battle(player1, player2):\n    # Initialize the result dictionary with empty lists for both players\n    result = {'player1': [], 'player2': []}\n    \n    # Iterate over the creatures of both players\n    for p1_creature, p2_creature in zip(player1, player2):\n        # Calculate the remaining toughness after the battle\n        p1_toughness_left = p1_creature[1] - p2_creature[0]\n        p2_toughness_left = p2_creature[1] - p1_creature[0]\n        \n        # If player 1's creature survives, add it to the result\n        if p1_toughness_left > 0:\n            result['player1'].append([p1_creature[0], p1_toughness_left])\n        # If player 2's creature survives, add it to the result\n        if p2_toughness_left > 0:\n            result['player2'].append([p2_creature[0], p2_toughness_left])\n    \n    # Add any unblocked creatures to the result\n    if len(player1) > len(player2):\n        result['player1'].extend(player1[len(player2):])\n    elif len(player2) > len(player1):\n        result['player2'].extend(player2[len(player1):])\n    \n    return result\n\n# Take input for player1 and player2 creatures\nplayer1_creatures = eval(input())\nplayer2_creatures = eval(input())\n\n# Call the battle function and print the result\nbattle_result = battle(player1_creatures, player2_creatures)\nprint(battle_result)\n```"], "prompt_tokens": [2075], "completion_tokens": [353], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": false, "language": "Python3", "task_id": 3478}

Any resemblance to real people or real events is **nothing more than a coincidence** and should be regarded as such.\n\n## Background Story\n\nYou are a person who loves to go to the gym everyday with the squad of people that you've known since early childhood.  However, you recently contracted a sickness that forced you to stay at home for over a week.  As you see your body getting weaker and weaker every day and as you see your biceps and triceps disappearing, you can't help but lay in bed and cry.

Your task is to define a function ```gymSlang``` which accepts a string argument and does the following:\n\n1. Replace *all* instances of ```\"probably\"``` to ```\"prolly\"```\n2. Replace *all* instances of ```\"i am\"``` to ```\"i'm\"```\n3. Replace *all* instances of ```\"instagram\"``` to ```\"insta\"```\n4. Replace *all* instances of ```\"do not\"``` to ```\"don't\"```\n5. Replace *all* instances of ```\"going to\"``` to ```\"gonna\"```\n6.

{"name": "4391", "description": "## The Story\nGreen Lantern's long hours of study and practice with his ring have really paid off -- his skills, focus, and control have improved so much that now he can even use his ring to update and redesign his web site. Earlier today he was focusing his will and a beam from his ring upon the Justice League web server, while intensely brainstorming and visualizing in minute detail different looks and ideas for his web site, and when he finished and reloaded his home page, he was absolutely thrilled to see that among other things it now displayed\n\n~~~~\nIn brightest day, in blackest night,\nThere's nothing cooler than my site!\n~~~~\n\nin his favorite font in very large blinking green letters.\n\nThe problem is, Green Lantern's ring has no power over anything yellow, so if he's experimenting with his web site and accidentally changes some text or background color to yellow, he will no longer be able to make any changes to those parts of the content or presentation (because he doesn't actually know any HTML, CSS, programming languages, frameworks, etc.) until he gets a more knowledgable friend to edit the code for him.\n\n## Your Mission\nYou can help Green Lantern by writing a function that will replace any color property values that are too yellow with shades of green or blue-green. Presumably at a later time the two of you will be doing some testing to find out at exactly which RGB values yellow stops being yellow and starts being off-white, orange, brown, etc. as far as his ring is concerned, but here's the plan to get version 1.0 up and running as soon as possible:\n\nYour function will receive either an HTML color name or a six-digit hex color code. (You're not going to bother with other types of color codes just now because you don't think they will come up.) If the color is too yellow, your function needs to return a green or blue-green shade instead, but if it is not too yellow, it needs to return the original color name or hex color code unchanged.\n\n### HTML Color Names\n(If don't know what HTML color names are, take a look at this HTML colors names reference.)\n\nFor HMTL color names, you are going to start out trying a pretty strict definition of yellow, replacing any of the following colors as specified:\n\n~~~~\nGold => ForestGreen\nKhaki => LimeGreen\nLemonChiffon => PaleGreen\nLightGoldenRodYellow => SpringGreen\nLightYellow => MintCream\nPaleGoldenRod => LightGreen\nYellow => Lime\n~~~~\n\nHTML color names are case-insensitive, so your function will need to be able to identify the above yellow shades regardless of the cases used, but should output the green shades as capitalized above.\n\nSome examples:\n```\n\"lemonchiffon\"    \"PaleGreen\"\n\"GOLD\"            \"ForestGreen\"\n\"pAlEgOlDeNrOd\"   \"LightGreen\"\n\"BlueViolet\"      \"BlueViolet\"\n```\n\n### Hex Color Codes\n(If you don't know what six-digit hex color codes are, take a look at this Wikipedia description. Basically the six digits are made up of three two-digit numbers in base 16, known as hexidecimal or hex, from 00 to FF (equivalent to 255 in base 10, also known as decimal), with the first two-digit number specifying the color's red value, the second the green value, and the third blue.)\n\nWith six-digit color hex codes, you are going to start out going really overboard, interpreting as \"yellow\" any hex code where the red (R) value and the green (G) value are each greater than the blue (B) value. When you find one of these \"yellow\" hex codes, your function will take the three hex values and rearrange them that the largest goes to G, the middle goes to B, and the smallest to R. \n\nFor example, with the six-digit hex color code `#FFD700`, which has an R value of hex FF (decimal 255), a G value of hex D7 (decimal 215), and a B value of hex 00 (decimal 0), as the R and G values are each larger than the B value, you would return it as `#00FFD7` -- the FF reassigned to G, the D7 to B, and the 00 to R. \n\nHex color codes are also case-insensitive, but your function should output them in the same case they were received in, just for consistency with whatever style is being used.\n\nSome examples:\n```\n\"#000000\"   \"#000000\"\n\"#b8860b\"   \"#0bb886\"\n\"#8FBC8F\"   \"#8FBC8F\"\n\"#C71585\"   \"#C71585\"\n```", "difficulty": "introductory", "id": 4391, "sample_io": [{"input": "lemonchiffon", "output": ["PaleGreen"]}, {"input": "GOLD", "output": ["ForestGreen"]}], "test_list": [{"input": "lemonchiffon", "output": ["PaleGreen"]}, {"input": "GOLD", "output": ["ForestGreen"]}, {"input": "pAlEgOlDeNrOd", "output": ["LightGreen"]}, {"input": "BlueViolet", "output": ["BlueViolet"]}, {"input": "#000000", "output": ["#000000"]}, {"input": "#b8860b", "output": ["#0bb886"]}, {"input": "#8FBC8F", "output": ["#8FBC8F"]}, {"input": "#C71585", "output": ["#C71585"]}], "starter_code": "\ndef yellow_be_gone(s):\n\t", "source_codes": ["\ndef replace_yellow(color):\n    # Define the mapping for HTML color names\n    html_color_names = {\n        \"gold\": \"ForestGreen\",\n        \"khaki\": \"LimeGreen\",\n        \"lemonchiffon\": \"PaleGreen\",\n        \"lightgoldenrodyellow\": \"SpringGreen\",\n        \"lightyellow\": \"MintCream\",\n        \"palegoldenrod\": \"LightGreen\",\n        \"yellow\": \"Lime\"\n    }\n    \n    # Check if the input is an HTML color name\n    color_lower = color.lower()\n    if color_lower in html_color_names:\n        return html_color_names[color_lower]\n    \n    # Check if the input is a hex color code\n    if color.startswith('#') and len(color) == 7:\n        r, g, b = int(color[1:3], 16), int(color[3:5], 16), int(color[5:7], 16)\n        if r > b and g > b:\n            # Sort the RGB values\n            sorted_colors = sorted([(r, 'R'), (g, 'G'), (b, 'B')], reverse=True)\n            # Map the sorted values to the new order G > B > R\n            new_order = {sorted_colors[i][1]: sorted_colors[(i + 1) % 3][0] for i in range(3)}\n            # Format the new hex color code\n            new_color = \"#{:02X}{:02X}{:02X}\".format(new_order['R'], new_order['G'], new_order['B'])\n            # Return the new color in the same case as the input\n            return new_color if color.isupper() else new_color.lower()\n    \n    # If the color is not yellow, return it unchanged\n    return color\n\n# Take input from standard input\ninput_color = input()\n\n# Call the function and print the output to standard output\nprint(replace_yellow(input_color))\n\n\n"], "responses": ["```python\ndef replace_yellow(color):\n    # Define the mapping for HTML color names\n    html_color_names = {\n        \"gold\": \"ForestGreen\",\n        \"khaki\": \"LimeGreen\",\n        \"lemonchiffon\": \"PaleGreen\",\n        \"lightgoldenrodyellow\": \"SpringGreen\",\n        \"lightyellow\": \"MintCream\",\n        \"palegoldenrod\": \"LightGreen\",\n        \"yellow\": \"Lime\"\n    }\n    \n    # Check if the input is an HTML color name\n    color_lower = color.lower()\n    if color_lower in html_color_names:\n        return html_color_names[color_lower]\n    \n    # Check if the input is a hex color code\n    if color.startswith('#') and len(color) == 7:\n        r, g, b = int(color[1:3], 16), int(color[3:5], 16), int(color[5:7], 16)\n        if r > b and g > b:\n            # Sort the RGB values\n            sorted_colors = sorted([(r, 'R'), (g, 'G'), (b, 'B')], reverse=True)\n            # Map the sorted values to the new order G > B > R\n            new_order = {sorted_colors[i][1]: sorted_colors[(i + 1) % 3][0] for i in range(3)}\n            # Format the new hex color code\n            new_color = \"#{:02X}{:02X}{:02X}\".format(new_order['R'], new_order['G'], new_order['B'])\n            # Return the new color in the same case as the input\n            return new_color if color.isupper() else new_color.lower()\n    \n    # If the color is not yellow, return it unchanged\n    return color\n\n# Take input from standard input\ninput_color = input()\n\n# Call the function and print the output to standard output\nprint(replace_yellow(input_color))\n```"], "prompt_tokens": [2640], "completion_tokens": [410], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": false, "language": "Python3", "task_id": 4391}

{"name": "1627", "description": "### Background\n\nI was reading a [book](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Things-Make-Do-Fourth-Dimension/dp/1846147646/) recently, \"Things to Make and Do in the Fourth Dimension\" by comedian and mathematician Matt Parker, and in the first chapter of the book Matt talks about problems he likes to solve in his head to take his mind off the fact that he is in his dentist's chair, we've all been there!\n\nThe problem he talks about relates to polydivisible numbers, and I thought a kata should be written on the subject as it's quite interesting. (Well it's interesting to me, so there!)\n\n### Polydivisib... huh what?\n\nSo what are they?\n\nA polydivisible number is divisible in an unusual way. The first digit is cleanly divisible by `1`, the first two digits are cleanly divisible by `2`, the first three by `3` and so on.\n\nThe interesting thing about polydivisiblity is that it relates to the underlying number, but not the base it is written in, so if aliens came to Earth and used base `23` (`11` fingers on one hand and `12` on the other), no matter what squiggles they use to write numbers, they would find the same numbers polydivisible!\n\n### Polydivisibilty Example:\n\nLet's do a worked example to clear up any questions ...\n\nStarting wih the number `1,232` in base `10` then:\n\n```\n 1232\n 1    /1 = 1    Yay!\n 12   /2 = 6    Yay!\n 123  /3 = 41   Yay!\n 1232 /4 = 308  Yay!\n```\n\nThus `1,232` is a polydivisible number in base `4` and above.\n\nHowever starting wih the number `123,220` and using base `10` then:\n\n```\n 123220\n 1      /1 = 1            Yay!\n 12     /2 = 6            Yay!\n 123    /3 = 41           Yay!\n 1232   /4 = 308          Yay!\n 12322  /5 = 2464.4       Oh no, that's not a round number!\n 123220 /6 = 220536.333r  Oh no, that's not a round number!\n```\n\nThus `123,220` is not a polydivisible base 10 number, but what about in another base?\n\nAgain starting wih the number `123,220` and using base `6` then:\n\n```\n base 6   base 10\n 1      = 1       -> 1     /1 = 1     Yay!\n 12     = 8       -> 8     /2 = 4     Yay!\n 123    = 51      -> 51    /3 = 17    Yay!\n 1232   = 308     -> 308   /4 = 77    Yay!\n 12322  = 1850    -> 1850  /5 = 370   Yay!\n 123220 = 11100   -> 11100 /6 = 1850  Yay!\n```\n\nThus `123,220` is a polydivisible base `6` number (and a polydivisible base `10` number when converted to `11100` in base `10`).\n\n### Kata\n\nIn this kata you must implement two methods: `is_polydivisible(n, b)` and `get_polydivisible(n, b)`.\n\nThe first `is_polydivisible(n, b)` will return `True` if `n` is polydivisible in base `b` or `False` if not.\n\nThe second `get_polydivisible(n, b)` will return the `n`th polydivisible number using base `b`, the first polydivisible number is of course always `0`.\n\nYou can assume that all inputs are valid.\n\n```if:haskell\nAll necessary arithmetic can be done in `Int` range.\n```\n\n### Kata Examples:\n\n```python\n    is_polydivisible(\"1232\", 10)   # => True\n    is_polydivisible(\"123220\", 10) # => False\n    is_polydivisible(\"123220\", 6)  # => True\n    get_polydivisible(22, 10)      # => \"32\"\n    get_polydivisible(22, 16)      # => \"1A\"\n    get_polydivisible(42, 16)      # => \"42\"\n```\n\n#### A Note on Bases\n\nThe maximum base used is base `62`, and uses characters in the following order `[0-9][A-Z][a-z]` to denote its digits, base `n` will use the first `n` characters of this sequence.\n```if-not:haskell\nA constant CHARS has been declared with this sequence for you.\n```", "difficulty": "interview", "id": 1627, "sample_io": [{"input": "123\n10", "output": [true]}, {"input": "1234\n10", "output": [false]}], "test_list": [{"input": "123\n10", "output": [true]}, {"input": "1234\n10", "output": [false]}, {"input": "12345\n10", "output": [false]}, {"input": "12365\n10", "output": [true]}, {"input": "123220\n10", "output": [false]}, {"input": "50041\n6", "output": [true]}, {"input": "140410\n6", "output": [true]}, {"input": "203230\n6", "output": [true]}, {"input": "30043052\n6", "output": [true]}], "starter_code": "\ndef is_polydivisible(s, b):\n\t", "source_codes": ["\nCHARS = \"0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\"\n\ndef is_polydivisible(s, b):\n    #

More formally, we investigate the sum of n components denoted by d(1) + d(2) + ... + d(n) in which for any i starting from 1 up to n the value of d(i) tells us how many distinct numbers divide i without a remainder. \n\nYour solution should work for possibly large values of n without a timeout.\nAssume n to be greater than zero and not greater than 999 999 999 999 999.\nBrute force approaches will not be feasible options in such cases. It is fairly simple to conclude that for every n>1 there holds a recurrence S(n) = S(n-1) + d(n) with initial case S(1) = 1.\n\nFor example:\nS(1) = 1\nS(2) = 3\nS(3) = 5\nS(4) = 8\nS(5) = 10\n\nBut is the fact useful anyway? If you find it is rather not, maybe this will help: \n\nTry to convince yourself that for any natural k, the number S(k) is the same as the number of pairs (m,n) that solve the inequality mn <= k in natural numbers.\nOnce it becomes clear, we can think of a partition of all the solutions into classes just by saying that a pair (m,n) belongs to the class indexed by n.\nThe question now arises if it is possible to count solutions of n-th class. If f(n) stands for the number of solutions that belong to n-th class, it means that S(k) = f(1) + f(2) + f(3) + ...\n\nThe reasoning presented above leads us to some kind of a formula for S(k), however not necessarily the most efficient one.

{"name": "1654", "description": "To give credit where credit is due: This problem was taken from the ACMICPC-Northwest Regional Programming Contest. Thank you problem writers.\n\nYou are helping an archaeologist decipher some runes. He knows that this ancient society used a Base 10 system, and that they never start a number with a leading zero. He's figured out most of the digits as well as a few operators, but he needs your help to figure out the rest.\n\nThe professor will give you a simple math expression, of the form\n\n```\n[number][op][number]=[number]\n```\n\nHe has converted all of the runes he knows into digits. The only operators he knows are addition (`+`),subtraction(`-`), and multiplication (`*`), so those are the only ones that will appear. Each number will be in the range from -1000000 to 1000000, and will consist of only the digits 0-9, possibly a leading -, and maybe a few ?s. If there are ?s in an expression, they represent a digit rune that the professor doesn't know (never an operator, and never a leading -). All of the ?s in an expression will represent the same digit (0-9), and it won't be one of the other given digits in the expression. No number will begin with a 0 unless the number itself is  0, therefore 00 would not be a valid number. \n\nGiven an expression, figure out the value of the rune represented by the question mark. If more than one digit works, give the lowest one. If no digit works, well, that's bad news for the professor - it means that he's got some of his runes wrong. output -1 in that case.\n\nComplete the method to solve the expression to find the value of the unknown rune. The method takes a string as a paramater repressenting the expression and will return an int value representing the unknown rune or -1 if no such rune exists.\n\n~~~if:php\n**Most of the time, the professor will be able to figure out most of the runes himself, but sometimes, there may be exactly 1 rune present in the expression that the professor cannot figure out (resulting in all question marks where the digits are in the expression) so be careful ;)**\n~~~", "difficulty": "interview", "id": 1654, "sample_io": [{"input": "123?45*?=?", "output": [0]}, {"input": "?*123?45=?", "output": [0]}], "test_list": [{"input": "123?45*?=?", "output": [0]}, {"input": "?*123?45=?", "output": [0]}, {"input": "??605*-63=-73???5", "output": [1]}, {"input": "123?45+?=123?45", "output": [0]}, {"input": "?8?170-1?6256=7?2?14", "output": [9]}, {"input": "?38???+595???=833444", "output": [2]}, {"input": "123?45-?=123?45", "output": [0]}, {"input": "-7715?5--484?00=-28?9?5", "output": [6]}, {"input": "50685?--1?5630=652?8?", "output": [4]}, {"input": "??+??=??", "output": [-1]}, {"input": "-?56373--9216=-?47157", "output": [8]}], "starter_code": "\ndef solve_runes(runes):\n\t", "source_codes": ["\nimport re\n\ndef solve_rune(rune):\n    # Replace the equals sign with minus to move everything to one side of the equation\n    expression = rune.replace('=', '-(') + ')'\n    # Find all the unique digits in the expression\n    digits = set(re.findall('[0-9]', expression))\n    # Loop through all possible digits for the rune\n    for d in range(10):\n        # Skip if the digit is already in the expression\n        if str(d) in digits:\n            continue\n        # Replace the rune with the current digit\n        trial = expression.replace('?', str(d))\n        # Skip if the replacement leads to numbers with leading zeros\n        if re.search(r'\\b0[0-9]', trial):\n            continue\n        # Evaluate the expression and check if it equals zero\n        if eval(trial) == 0:\n            return d\n    # If no digit works, return -1\n    return -1\n\n# Read the input from standard input\nrune = input()\n\n# Call the function and print the result to standard output\nprint(solve_rune(rune))\n\n\n"], "responses": ["```python\nimport re\n\ndef solve_rune(rune):\n    # Replace the equals sign with minus to move everything to one side of the equation\n    expression = rune.replace('=', '-(') + ')'\n    # Find all the unique digits in the expression\n    digits = set(re.findall('[0-9]', expression))\n    # Loop through all possible digits for the rune\n    for d in range(10):\n        # Skip if the digit is already in the expression\n        if str(d) in digits:\n            continue\n        # Replace the rune with the current digit\n        trial = expression.replace('?', str(d))\n        # Skip if the replacement leads to numbers with leading zeros\n        if re.search(r'\\b0[0-9]', trial):\n            continue\n        # Evaluate the expression and check if it equals zero\n        if eval(trial) == 0:\n            return d\n    # If no digit works, return -1\n    return -1\n\n# Read the input from standard input\nrune = input()\n\n# Call the function and print the result to standard output\nprint(solve_rune(rune))\n```"], "prompt_tokens": [2120], "completion_tokens": [237], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": false, "language": "Python3", "task_id": 1654}

if the absolute value of the result is <1, you have of course to put one (and only one) leading 0 before the decimal separator.\n\nFinally, you may assume that decimals if provided will always be >= 0 and that no test base will be smaller than 2 (because, you know, converting to base 1 is pretty lame) or greater than 36; as usual, for digits greater than 9 you can use uppercase alphabet letter, so your base of numeration is going to be: '0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'.\n\nThat is my first 3-languages-kata, so I count on you all to give me extensive feedback, no matter how harsh it may sound, so to improve myself even further :)", "difficulty": "interview", "id": 1617, "sample_io": [{"input": "13", "output": ["103"]}, {"input": "10", "output": ["100"]}], "test_list": [{"input": "13", "output": ["103"]}, {"input": "10", "output": ["100"]}, {"input": "13\n3", "output": ["103.010"]}, {"input": "13\n0\n8", "output": ["15"]}, {"input": "10\n0\n16", "output": ["A"]}, {"input": "10000\n4\n13", "output": ["4723.0000"]}, {"input": "7\n0\n19", "output": ["7"]}, {"input": "13.5\n4\n16", "output": ["D.8000"]}, {"input": "10.81\n0\n16", "output": ["A"]}, {"input": "1\n2\n2", "output": ["1.00"]}, {"input": "-10\n0\n23", "output": ["-A"]}, {"input": "0\n4\n26", "output": ["0.0000"]}, {"input": "-15.5\n2\n23", "output": ["-F.BB"]}, {"input": "13\n0\n10", "output": ["13"]}, {"input": "5.5\n1\n10", "output": ["5.5"]}], "starter_code": "\ndef converter(n, decimals=0, base=pi):\n\t", "source_codes": ["\nimport math\n\ndef converter(number, decimals=0, base=math.pi):\n    # Handle negative numbers\n    negative = number < 0\n    number = abs(number)\n    \n    # Convert integer part\n    integer_part = int(number)\n    result = ''\n    while integer_part:\n        result = '0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'[integer_part % base] + result\n        integer_part //= base\n    \n    # If the result is empty, the number was 0\n    if not result:\n        result = '0'\n    \n    # Add the negative sign back if necessary\n    if negative:\n        result = '-' + result\n    \n    # Convert decimal part\n    if decimals:\n        result += '.'\n        decimal_part = number - int(number)\n        for _ in range(decimals):\n            decimal_part *= base\n            digit = int(decimal_part)\n            result += '0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'[digit]\n            decimal_part -= digit\n    \n    return result\n\n# Take input from standard input and process it\nnumber = float(input())\ndecimals = int(input()) if '.' in str(number) else 0\nbase = int(input()) if not math.isclose(number % 1, 0) else math.pi\n\n# Call the function and print the result to standard output\nprint(converter(number, decimals, base))\n\n\n"], "responses": ["```python\nimport math\n\ndef converter(number, decimals=0, base=math.pi):\n    # Handle negative numbers\n    negative = number < 0\n    number = abs(number)\n    \n    # Convert integer part\n    integer_part = int(number)\n    result = ''\n    while integer_part:\n        result = '0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'[integer_part % base] + result\n        integer_part //= base\n    \n    # If the result is empty, the number was 0\n    if not result:\n        result = '0'\n    \n    # Add the negative sign back if necessary\n    if negative:\n        result = '-' + result\n    \n    # Convert decimal part\n    if decimals:\n        result += '.'\n        decimal_part = number - int(number)\n        for _ in range(decimals):\n            decimal_part *= base\n            digit = int(decimal_part)\n            result += '0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'[digit]\n            decimal_part -= digit\n    \n    return result\n\n# Take input from standard input and process it\nnumber = float(input())\ndecimals = int(input()) if '.' in str(number) else 0\nbase = int(input()) if not math.isclose(number % 1, 0) else math.pi\n\n# Call the function and print the result to standard output\nprint(converter(number, decimals, base))\n```"], "prompt_tokens": [2127], "completion_tokens": [275], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": false, "language": "Python3", "task_id": 1617}

Same goes for all the numbers up to 109, while 110 is again a decreasing number.\n\nNow your task is rather easy to declare (a bit less to perform): you have to build a function to return the total occurrences of all the increasing or decreasing numbers *below* 10 raised to the xth power (x will always be >= 0).\n\nTo give you a starting point, there are a grand total of increasing and decreasing numbers as shown in the table:\n\n|Total  | Below\n|---------------\n|1      | 1\n|10     | 10\n|100    | 100\n|475    | 1000\n|1675   | 10000\n|4954   | 100000\n|12952  | 1000000\n\nThis means that your function will have to behave like this:\n```python\ntotal_inc_dec(0)==1\ntotal_inc_dec(1)==10\ntotal_inc_dec(2)==100\ntotal_inc_dec(3)==475\ntotal_inc_dec(4)==1675\ntotal_inc_dec(5)==4954\ntotal_inc_dec(6)==12952\n```\n\n**Tips:** efficiency and trying to figure out how it works are essential: with a brute force approach, some tests with larger numbers may take more than the total computing power currently on Earth to be finished in the short allotted time.\n\nTo make it even clearer, the increasing or decreasing numbers between in the range 101-200 are: [110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 155, 156, 157, 158, 159, 166, 167, 168, 169, 177, 178, 179, 188, 189, 199, 200], that is 47 of them. In the following range, 201-300, there are 41 of them and so on, getting rarer and rarer.\n\n**Trivia:** just for the sake of your own curiosity, a number which is neither decreasing of increasing is called a `bouncy` number, like, say, 3848 or 37294; also, usually 0 is not considered being increasing, decreasing or bouncy, but it will be for the purpose of this kata", "difficulty": "interview", "id": 1634, "sample_io": [{"input": "0", "output": [1]}, {"input": "1", "output": [10]}], "test_list": [{"input": "0", "output": [1]}, {"input": "1", "output": [10]}, {"input": "2", "output": [100]}, {"input": "3", "output": [475]}, {"input": "4", "output": [1675]}, {"input": "5", "output": [4954]}, {"input": "6", "output": [12952]}, {"input": "10", "output": [277033]}, {"input": "20", "output": [40059819]}, {"input": "50", "output": [87959698326]}], "starter_code": "\ndef total_inc_dec(x):\n\t", "source_codes": ["\nfrom math import comb\n\ndef total_inc_dec(x):\n    # The total number of increasing numbers is given by the binomial coefficient (9 + x choose x)\n    # The total number of decreasing numbers is given by the binomial coefficient (10 + x choose x)\n    # We subtract the 10 * x to account for the numbers that are both increasing and decreasing (single digit numbers repeated)\n    # We add 1 for the number 0, which is considered both increasing and decreasing\n    return comb(9 + x, x) + comb(10 + x, x) - 10 * x + 1\n\n# Take input from standard input\nx = int(input())\n\n# Call the function and print the output to standard output\nprint(total_inc_dec(x))\n\n\n"], "responses": ["```python\nfrom math import comb\n\ndef total_inc_dec(x):\n    # The total number of increasing numbers is given by the binomial coefficient (9 + x choose x)\n    # The total number of decreasing numbers is given by the binomial coefficient (10 + x choose x)\n    # We subtract the 10 * x to account for the numbers that are both increasing and decreasing (single digit numbers repeated)\n    # We add 1 for the number 0, which is considered both increasing and decreasing\n    return comb(9 + x, x) + comb(10 + x, x) - 10 * x + 1\n\n# Take input from standard input\nx = int(input())\n\n# Call the function and print the output to standard output\nprint(total_inc_dec(x))\n```"], "prompt_tokens": [2345], "completion_tokens": [163], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": false, "language": "Python3", "task_id": 1634}

The first digit is cleanly divisible by `1`, the first two digits are cleanly divisible by `2`, the first three by `3` and so on.\n\nThe interesting thing about polydivisiblity is that it relates to the underlying number, but not the base it is written in, so if aliens came to Earth and used base `23` (`11` fingers on one hand and `12` on the other), no matter what squiggles they use to write numbers, they would find the same numbers polydivisible!\n\n### Polydivisibilty Example:\n\nLet's do a worked example to clear up any questions ...\n\nStarting wih the number `1,232` in base `10` then:\n\n```\n 1232\n 1    /1 = 1    Yay!\n 12   /2 = 6    Yay!\n 123  /3 = 41   Yay!\n 1232 /4 = 308  Yay!\n```\n\nThus `1,232` is a polydivisible number in base `4` and above.\n\nHowever starting wih the number `123,220` and using base `10` then:\n\n```\n 123220\n 1      /1 = 1            Yay!\n 12     /2 = 6            Yay!\n 123    /3 = 41           Yay!\n 1232   /4 = 308          Yay!\n 12322  /5 = 2464.4       Oh no, that's not a round number!\n 123220 /6 = 220536.333r  Oh no, that's not a round number!\n```\n\nThus `123,220` is not a polydivisible base 10 number, but what about in another base?\n\nAgain starting wih the number `123,220` and using base `6` then:\n\n```\n base 6   base 10\n 1      = 1       -> 1     /1 = 1     Yay!\n 12     = 8       -> 8     /2 = 4     Yay!\n 123    = 51      -> 51    /3 = 17    Yay!\n 1232   = 308     -> 308   /4 = 77    Yay!\n 12322  = 1850    -> 1850  /5 = 370   Yay!\n 123220 = 11100   -> 11100 /6 = 1850  Yay!\n```\n\nThus `123,220` is a polydivisible base `6` number (and a polydivisible base `10` number when converted to `11100` in base `10`).\n\n### Kata\n\nIn this kata you must implement two methods: `is_polydivisible(n, b)` and `get_polydivisible(n, b)`.\n\nThe first `is_polydivisible(n, b)` will return `True` if `n` is polydivisible in base `b` or `False` if not.\n\nThe second `get_polydivisible(n, b)` will return the `n`th polydivisible number using base `b`, the first polydivisible number is of course always `0`.\n\nYou can assume that all inputs are valid.\n\n```if:haskell\nAll necessary arithmetic can be done in `Int` range.\n```\n\n### Kata Examples:\n\n```python\n    is_polydivisible(\"1232\", 10)   # => True\n    is_polydivisible(\"123220\", 10) # => False\n    is_polydivisible(\"123220\", 6)  # => True\n    get_polydivisible(22, 10)      # => \"32\"\n    get_polydivisible(22, 16)      # => \"1A\"\n    get_polydivisible(42, 16)      # => \"42\"\n```\n\n#### A Note on Bases\n\nThe maximum base used is base `62`, and uses characters in the following order `[0-9][A-Z][a-z]` to denote its digits, base `n` will use the first `n` characters of this sequence.\n```if-not:haskell\nA constant CHARS has been declared with this sequence for you.\n```", "difficulty": "interview", "id": 1627, "sample_io": [{"input": "123\n10", "output": [true]}, {"input": "1234\n10", "output": [false]}], "test_list": [{"input": "123\n10", "output": [true]}, {"input": "1234\n10", "output": [false]}, {"input": "12345\n10", "output": [false]}, {"input": "12365\n10", "output": [true]}, {"input": "123220\n10", "output": [false]}, {"input": "50041\n6", "output": [true]}, {"input": "140410\n6", "output": [true]}, {"input": "203230\n6", "output": [true]}, {"input": "30043052\n6", "output": [true]}], "starter_code": "\ndef is_polydivisible(s, b):\n\t", "source_codes": ["\nCHARS = \"0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\"\n\ndef is_polydivisible(s, b):\n    #

In fact, it contains it more than 2 million times! To thank him, you'd like to reply with exactly how many times it occurs.\n\nTo count all the occurences, the procedure is as follows: look through the paragraph and find a `'h'`; then find an `'a'` later in the paragraph; then find an `'p'` after that, and so on. Now count the number of ways in which you can choose letters in this way to make the full phrase.\n\nMore precisely, given a text string, you are to determine how many times the search string appears as a sub-sequence of that string.\n\nWrite a function called `countSubsequences` that takes two arguments: `needle`, the string to be search for and `haystack`, the string to search in. In our example, `\"happy birthday\"` is the needle and the birthday message is the haystack. The function should return the number of times `needle` occurs as a sub-sequence of `haystack`.  Spaces are also considered part of the needle.\n\nSince the answers can be very large, return only the last 8 digits of the answer in case it exceeds 8 digits.

You can only move right or down, one cell per step. Moving right from a cell $(x, y)$ takes you to the cell $(x, y + 1)$, while moving down takes you to the cell $(x + 1, y)$.\n\nSome cells of the labyrinth contain rocks. When you move to a cell with rock, the rock is pushed to the next cell in the direction you're moving.

{"name": "1622", "description": "# Ten-Pin Bowling\n\nIn the game of ten-pin bowling, a player rolls a bowling ball down a lane to knock over pins. There are ten pins set at the end of the bowling lane. Each player has 10 frames to roll a bowling ball down a lane and knock over as many pins as possible. The first nine frames are ended after two rolls or when the player knocks down all the pins. The last frame a player will receive an extra roll every time they knock down all ten pins; up to a maximum of three total rolls. \n\n## The Challenge\n\nIn this challenge you will be given a string representing a player's ten frames. It will look something like this: `'X X 9/ 80 X X 90 8/ 7/ 44'` (in Java: `\"X X 9/ 80 X X 90 8/ 7/ 44\"`), where each frame is space-delimited, `'X'` represents strikes, and `'/'` represents spares. Your goal is take in this string of frames into a function called `bowlingScore` and return the players total score.\n\n## Scoring\n\nThe scoring for ten-pin bowling can be difficult to understand, and if you're like most people, easily forgotten if you don't play often. Here is a quick breakdown:\n\n### Frames\n\nIn Ten-Pin Bowling there are ten frames per game. Frames are the players turn to bowl, which can be multiple rolls. The first 9 frames you get 2 rolls maximum to try to get all 10 pins down. **On the 10th or last frame a player will receive an extra roll each time they get all ten pins down to a maximum of three total rolls. Also on the last frame bonuses are not awarded for strikes and spares moving forward.**\n\nIn this challenge, three frames might be represented like this: `54 72 44`. In this case, the player has had three frames. On their first frame they scored 9 points (5 + 4), on their second frame they scored 9 points (7 + 2) and on their third frame they scored 8 points (4 + 4). This is a very simple example of bowling scoring. It gets more complicated when we introduce strikes and spares.\n\n### Strikes \nRepresented in this challenge as `'X'`\n\nA strike is scored when a player knocks all ten pins down in one roll. In the first 9 frames this will conclude the players turn and it will be scored as 10 points plus the points received from the next two rolls. So if a player were to have two frames `X 54`, the total score of those two frames would be 28. The first frame would be worth 19 (10 + 5 + 4) and the second frame would be worth 9 (5 + 4).\n\nA perfect game in bowling is 12 strikes in a row and would be represented like this `'X X X X X X X X X XXX'` (in Java: `\"X X X X X X X X X XXX\"`). This adds up to a total score of 300.\n\n### Spares\nRepresented in this challenge as `'/'`\n\nA spare is scored when a player knocks down all ten pins in two rolls. In the first 9 frames this will be scored as 10 points plus the next roll. So if a player were to have two frames `9/ 54`, the total score of the two frames would be 24. The first frame would be worth 15 (10 + 5) and the second frame would be worth 9 (5 + 4).\n\nFor a more detailed explanation see Wikipedia: \n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten-pin_bowling#Scoring", "difficulty": "interview", "id": 1622, "sample_io": [{"input": "11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11", "output": [20]}, {"input": "X X X X X X X X X XXX", "output": [300]}], "test_list": [{"input": "11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11", "output": [20]}, {"input": "X X X X X X X X X XXX", "output": [300]}, {"input": "00 5/ 4/ 53 33 22 4/ 5/ 45 XXX", "output": [115]}, {"input": "5/ 4/ 3/ 2/ 1/ 0/ X 9/ 4/ 8/8", "output": [150]}, {"input": "5/ 4/ 3/ 2/ 1/ 0/ X 9/ 4/ 7/2", "output": [143]}, {"input": "X X 9/ 80 X X 90 8/ 7/ 44", "output": [171]}, {"input": "6/ 5/ 6/ 2/ 3/ 0/ 1/ 8/ 3/ 6/5", "output": [139]}, {"input": "00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 0/X", "output": [20]}, {"input": "00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 X 0/X", "output": [40]}], "starter_code": "\ndef bowling_score(frames):\n\t", "source_codes": ["\ndef bowlingScore(frames):\n    # Split the frames into a list\n    frames_list = frames.split()\n    # Initialize the score and roll index\n    score = 0\n    roll = 0\n    # Process each frame\n    for frame_index in range(10):\n        frame = frames_list[frame_index]\n        # Strike\n        if frame[0] == 'X':\n            score += 10\n            # Bonus for strike: next two rolls\n            if frame_index < 9:  # Not the last frame\n                next_frame = frames_list[frame_index + 1]\n                score += 10 if next_frame[0] == 'X' else int(next_frame[0])\n                if len(next_frame) > 1:\n                    score += 10 if next_frame[1] == 'X' else (10 - int(next_frame[0])) if next_frame[1] == '/' else int(next_frame[1])\n                if next_frame[0] == 'X' and frame_index < 8:\n                    second_next_frame = frames_list[frame_index + 2]\n                    score += 10 if second_next_frame[0] == 'X' else int(second_next_frame[0])\n        # Spare\n        elif '/' in frame:\n            score += 10\n            # Bonus for spare: next one roll\n            if frame_index < 9:  # Not the last frame\n                next_frame = frames_list[frame_index + 1]\n                score += 10 if next_frame[0] == 'X' else int(next_frame[0])\n        # Open frame\n        else:\n            score += sum(int(pin) for pin in frame)\n    return score\n\n# Take input from standard input\nframes_input = input()\n\n# Call the function and print the output\nprint(bowlingScore(frames_input))\n\n\n"], "responses": ["```python\ndef bowlingScore(frames):\n    # Split the frames into a list\n    frames_list = frames.split()\n    # Initialize the score and roll index\n    score = 0\n    roll = 0\n    # Process each frame\n    for frame_index in range(10):\n        frame = frames_list[frame_index]\n        # Strike\n        if frame[0] == 'X':\n            score += 10\n            # Bonus for strike: next two rolls\n            if frame_index < 9:  # Not the last frame\n                next_frame = frames_list[frame_index + 1]\n                score += 10 if next_frame[0] == 'X' else int(next_frame[0])\n                if len(next_frame) > 1:\n                    score += 10 if next_frame[1] == 'X' else (10 - int(next_frame[0])) if next_frame[1] == '/' else int(next_frame[1])\n                if next_frame[0] == 'X' and frame_index < 8:\n                    second_next_frame = frames_list[frame_index + 2]\n                    score += 10 if second_next_frame[0] == 'X' else int(second_next_frame[0])\n        # Spare\n        elif '/' in frame:\n            score += 10\n            # Bonus for spare: next one roll\n            if frame_index < 9:  # Not the last frame\n                next_frame = frames_list[frame_index + 1]\n                score += 10 if next_frame[0] == 'X' else int(next_frame[0])\n        # Open frame\n        else:\n            score += sum(int(pin) for pin in frame)\n    return score\n\n# Take input from standard input\nframes_input = input()\n\n# Call the function and print the output\nprint(bowlingScore(frames_input))\n```"], "prompt_tokens": [2438], "completion_tokens": [381], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": false, "language": "Python3", "task_id": 1622}

return `\"ERROR\"`.\n\n### Action of each event upon each state:\n(the format is `INITIAL_STATE: EVENT -> NEW_STATE`)\n\n```\nCLOSED: APP_PASSIVE_OPEN -> LISTEN\nCLOSED: APP_ACTIVE_OPEN  -> SYN_SENT\nLISTEN: RCV_SYN          -> SYN_RCVD\nLISTEN: APP_SEND         -> SYN_SENT\nLISTEN: APP_CLOSE        -> CLOSED\nSYN_RCVD: APP_CLOSE      -> FIN_WAIT_1\nSYN_RCVD: RCV_ACK        ->

{"name": "1622", "description": "# Ten-Pin Bowling\n\nIn the game of ten-pin bowling, a player rolls a bowling ball down a lane to knock over pins. There are ten pins set at the end of the bowling lane. Each player has 10 frames to roll a bowling ball down a lane and knock over as many pins as possible. The first nine frames are ended after two rolls or when the player knocks down all the pins. The last frame a player will receive an extra roll every time they knock down all ten pins; up to a maximum of three total rolls. \n\n## The Challenge\n\nIn this challenge you will be given a string representing a player's ten frames. It will look something like this: `'X X 9/ 80 X X 90 8/ 7/ 44'` (in Java: `\"X X 9/ 80 X X 90 8/ 7/ 44\"`), where each frame is space-delimited, `'X'` represents strikes, and `'/'` represents spares. Your goal is take in this string of frames into a function called `bowlingScore` and return the players total score.\n\n## Scoring\n\nThe scoring for ten-pin bowling can be difficult to understand, and if you're like most people, easily forgotten if you don't play often. Here is a quick breakdown:\n\n### Frames\n\nIn Ten-Pin Bowling there are ten frames per game. Frames are the players turn to bowl, which can be multiple rolls. The first 9 frames you get 2 rolls maximum to try to get all 10 pins down. **On the 10th or last frame a player will receive an extra roll each time they get all ten pins down to a maximum of three total rolls. Also on the last frame bonuses are not awarded for strikes and spares moving forward.**\n\nIn this challenge, three frames might be represented like this: `54 72 44`. In this case, the player has had three frames. On their first frame they scored 9 points (5 + 4), on their second frame they scored 9 points (7 + 2) and on their third frame they scored 8 points (4 + 4). This is a very simple example of bowling scoring. It gets more complicated when we introduce strikes and spares.\n\n### Strikes \nRepresented in this challenge as `'X'`\n\nA strike is scored when a player knocks all ten pins down in one roll. In the first 9 frames this will conclude the players turn and it will be scored as 10 points plus the points received from the next two rolls. So if a player were to have two frames `X 54`, the total score of those two frames would be 28. The first frame would be worth 19 (10 + 5 + 4) and the second frame would be worth 9 (5 + 4).\n\nA perfect game in bowling is 12 strikes in a row and would be represented like this `'X X X X X X X X X XXX'` (in Java: `\"X X X X X X X X X XXX\"`). This adds up to a total score of 300.\n\n### Spares\nRepresented in this challenge as `'/'`\n\nA spare is scored when a player knocks down all ten pins in two rolls. In the first 9 frames this will be scored as 10 points plus the next roll. So if a player were to have two frames `9/ 54`, the total score of the two frames would be 24.

{"name": "1604", "description": "You are at the top left cell $(1, 1)$ of an $n \\times m$ labyrinth. Your goal is to get to the bottom right cell $(n, m)$. You can only move right or down, one cell per step. Moving right from a cell $(x, y)$ takes you to the cell $(x, y + 1)$, while moving down takes you to the cell $(x + 1, y)$.\n\nSome cells of the labyrinth contain rocks. When you move to a cell with rock, the rock is pushed to the next cell in the direction you're moving. If the next cell contains a rock, it gets pushed further, and so on.\n\nThe labyrinth is surrounded by impenetrable walls, thus any move that would put you or any rock outside of the labyrinth is illegal.\n\nCount the number of different legal paths you can take from the start to the goal modulo $10^9 + 7$. Two paths are considered different if there is at least one cell that is visited in one path, but not visited in the other.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains two integers $n, m$\u00a0\u2014 dimensions of the labyrinth ($1 \\leq n, m \\leq 2000$).\n\nNext $n$ lines describe the labyrinth.

{"name": "1663", "description": "In this Kata we focus on finding a sum S(n) which is the total number of divisors taken for all natural numbers less or equal to n. More formally, we investigate the sum of n components denoted by d(1) + d(2) + ... + d(n) in which for any i starting from 1 up to n the value of d(i) tells us how many distinct numbers divide i without a remainder. \n\nYour solution should work for possibly large values of n without a timeout.\nAssume n to be greater than zero and not greater than 999 999 999 999 999.\nBrute force approaches will not be feasible options in such cases. It is fairly simple to conclude that for every n>1 there holds a recurrence S(n) = S(n-1) + d(n) with initial case S(1) = 1.\n\nFor example:\nS(1) = 1\nS(2) = 3\nS(3) = 5\nS(4) = 8\nS(5) = 10\n\nBut is the fact useful anyway? If you find it is rather not, maybe this will help: \n\nTry to convince yourself that for any natural k, the number S(k) is the same as the number of pairs (m,n) that solve the inequality mn <= k in natural numbers.\nOnce it becomes clear, we can think of a partition of all the solutions into classes just by saying that a pair (m,n) belongs to the class indexed by n.\nThe question now arises if it is possible to count solutions of n-th class. If f(n) stands for the number of solutions that belong to n-th class, it means that S(k) = f(1) + f(2) + f(3) + ...\n\nThe reasoning presented above leads us to some kind of a formula for S(k), however not necessarily the most efficient one. Can you imagine that all the solutions to inequality mn <= k can be split using sqrt(k) as pivotal item?", "difficulty": "interview", "id": 1663, "sample_io": [{"input": "5", "output": [10]}, {"input": "10", "output": [27]}], "test_list": [{"input": "5", "output": [10]}, {"input": "10", "output": [27]}, {"input": "20", "output": [66]}, {"input": "59", "output": [249]}, {"input": "105", "output": [510]}, {"input": "785", "output": [5364]}, {"input": "1001", "output": [7077]}, {"input": "8009", "output": [73241]}, {"input": "9999999999999", "output": [300880375389561]}, {"input": "9999999999998", "output": [300880375389537]}, {"input": "9999999999995", "output": [300880375389493]}, {"input": "9999999949950", "output": [300880373832097]}], "starter_code": "\ndef count_divisors(n):\n\t", "source_codes": ["\ndef sum_of_divisors(n):\n    # Initialize the sum of divisors\n    S = 0\n    # Iterate over each number from 1 to n\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        # Count the number of divisors of i\n        divisors_count = sum(1 for j in range(1, int(i**0.5) + 1) if i % j == 0)\n        # Add the count of divisors to the total sum\n        S += divisors_count * 2 - (i**0.5).is_integer()\n    return S\n\n# Take input from standard input\nk = int(input())\n\n# Call the function and print the result to standard output\nprint(sum_of_divisors(k))\n\n\n"], "responses": ["```python\ndef sum_of_divisors(n):\n    # Initialize the sum of divisors\n    S = 0\n    # Iterate over each number from 1 to n\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        # Count the number of divisors of i\n        divisors_count = sum(1 for j in range(1, int(i**0.5) + 1) if i % j == 0)\n        # Add the count of divisors to the total sum\n        S += divisors_count * 2 - (i**0.5).is_integer()\n    return S\n\n# Take input from standard input\nk = int(input())\n\n# Call the function and print the result to standard output\nprint(sum_of_divisors(k))\n```"], "prompt_tokens": [2062], "completion_tokens": [164], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": false, "language": "Python3", "task_id": 1663}

How many different ways of swapping two digits in $a$ (only in $a$, not $b$) so that bitwise OR of these two numbers will be changed? In other words, let $c$ be the bitwise OR of $a$ and $b$, you need to find the number of ways of swapping two bits in $a$ so that bitwise OR will not be equal to $c$.\n\nNote that binary numbers can contain leading zeros so that length of each number is exactly $n$.\n\nBitwise OR is a binary operation.

NEKO's task is to lead a Nekomimi girl from cell $(1, 1)$ to the gate at $(2, n)$ and escape the maze. The girl can only move between cells sharing a common side.\n\nHowever, at some moments during the game, some cells may change their state: either from normal ground to lava (which forbids movement into that cell), or vice versa (which makes that cell passable again). Initially all cells are of the ground type.\n\nAfter hours of streaming, NEKO finally figured out there are only $q$ such moments: the $i$-th moment toggles the state of cell $(r_i, c_i)$ (either from ground to lava or vice versa).\n\nKnowing this, NEKO wonders, after each of the $q$ moments, whether it is still possible to move from cell $(1, 1)$ to cell $(2, n)$ without going through any lava cells.\n\nAlthough NEKO is a great streamer and gamer, she still can't get through quizzes and problems requiring large amount of Brain Power.

After the second query, it's impossible to move to the goal, since the farthest cell she could reach is $(1, 3)$.  After the fourth query, the $(2, 3)$ is not blocked, but now all the $4$-th column is blocked, so she still can't reach the goal.

This game needs a huge space, so they play it with a computer.\n\nIn this game there are n objects numbered from 1 to n arranged in a circle (in clockwise order). Object number 1 is a black hole and the others are planets. There's a monster in one of the planet. Rick and Morty don't know on which one yet, only that he's not initially in the black hole, but Unity will inform them before the game starts. But for now, they want to be prepared for every possible scenario. [Image] \n\nEach one of them has a set of numbers between 1 and n - 1 (inclusive). Rick's set is s_1 with k_1 elements and Morty's is s_2 with k_2 elements. One of them goes first and the player changes alternatively. In each player's turn, he should choose an arbitrary number like x from his set and the monster will move to his x-th next object from its current position (clockwise). If after his move the monster gets to the black hole he wins.\n\nYour task is that for each of monster's initial positions and who plays first determine if the starter wins, loses, or the game will stuck in an infinite loop.

{"name": "2183", "description": "We start with a string $s$ consisting only of the digits $1$, $2$, or $3$. The length of $s$ is denoted by $|s|$. For each $i$ from $1$ to $|s|$, the $i$-th character of $s$ is denoted by $s_i$. \n\nThere is one cursor. The cursor's location $\\ell$ is denoted by an integer in $\\{0, \\ldots, |s|\\}$, with the following meaning:   If $\\ell = 0$, then the cursor is located before the first character of $s$.  If $\\ell = |s|$, then the cursor is located right after the last character of $s$.  If $0 < \\ell < |s|$, then the cursor is located between $s_\\ell$ and $s_{\\ell+1}$. \n\nWe denote by $s_\\text{left}$ the string to the left of the cursor and $s_\\text{right}$ the string to the right of the cursor. \n\nWe also have a string $c$, which we call our clipboard, which starts out as empty. There are three types of actions:  The Move action. Move the cursor one step to the right. This increments $\\ell$ once.  The Cut action. Set $c \\leftarrow s_\\text{right}$, then set $s \\leftarrow s_\\text{left}$.  The Paste action. Append the value of $c$ to the end of the string $s$. Note that this doesn't modify $c$. \n\nThe cursor initially starts at $\\ell = 0$. Then, we perform the following procedure:  Perform the Move action once.  Perform the Cut action once.  Perform the Paste action $s_\\ell$ times.  If $\\ell = x$, stop. Otherwise, return to step 1. \n\nYou're given the initial string $s$ and the integer $x$. What is the length of $s$ when the procedure stops? Since this value may be very large, only find it modulo $10^9 + 7$. \n\nIt is guaranteed that $\\ell \\le |s|$ at any time.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of input contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 1000$) denoting the number of test cases. The next lines contain descriptions of the test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer $x$ ($1 \\le x \\le 10^6$). The second line of each test case consists of the initial string $s$ ($1 \\le |s| \\le 500$). It is guaranteed, that $s$ consists of the characters \"1\", \"2\", \"3\".\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $x$ in a single file is at most $10^6$. It is guaranteed that in each test case before the procedure will stop it will be true that $\\ell \\le |s|$ at any time.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each test case, output a single line containing a single integer denoting the answer for that test case modulo $10^9 + 7$. \n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n4\n5\n231\n7\n2323\n6\n333\n24\n133321333\n\nOutput\n25\n1438\n1101\n686531475\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nLet's illustrate what happens with the first test case. Initially, we have $s = $ 231. Initially, $\\ell = 0$ and $c = \\varepsilon$ (the empty string). The following things happen if we follow the procedure above:\n\n  Step 1, Move once: we get $\\ell = 1$.  Step 2, Cut once: we get $s = $ 2 and $c = $ 31.  Step 3, Paste $s_\\ell = $ 2 times: we get $s = $ 23131.  Step 4: $\\ell = 1 \\not= x = 5$, so we return to step 1. \n\n  Step 1, Move once: we get $\\ell = 2$.  Step 2, Cut once: we get $s = $ 23 and $c = $ 131.  Step 3, Paste $s_\\ell = $ 3 times: we get $s = $ 23131131131.  Step 4: $\\ell = 2 \\not= x = 5$, so we return to step 1. \n\n  Step 1, Move once: we get $\\ell = 3$.  Step 2, Cut once: we get $s = $ 231 and $c = $ 31131131.  Step 3, Paste $s_\\ell = $ 1 time: we get $s = $ 23131131131.  Step 4: $\\ell = 3 \\not= x = 5$, so we return to step 1. \n\n  Step 1, Move once: we get $\\ell = 4$.  Step 2, Cut once: we get $s = $ 2313 and $c = $ 1131131.  Step 3, Paste $s_\\ell = $ 3 times: we get $s = $ 2313113113111311311131131.  Step 4: $\\ell = 4 \\not= x = 5$, so we return to step 1. \n\n  Step 1, Move once: we get $\\ell = 5$.  Step 2, Cut once: we get $s = $ 23131 and $c = $ 13113111311311131131.  Step 3, Paste $s_\\ell = $ 1 times: we get $s = $ 2313113113111311311131131.  Step 4: $\\ell = 5 = x$, so we stop. \n\nAt the end of the procedure, $s$ has length $25$.", "difficulty": "competition", "id": 2183, "sample_io": [{"input": "4\n5\n231\n7\n2323\n6\n333\n24\n133321333\n", "output": ["25\n1438\n1101\n686531475\n"]}, {"input": "9\n1500\n1212\n1500\n1221\n1500\n122\n1500\n12121\n1500\n22\n1500\n1111112111111112\n1500\n1111111111221111111\n1500\n111111122\n1500\n11111121111121111111\n", "output": ["1504\n1599\n1502\n1598\n1502\n1510\n1657\n1502\n1763\n"]}], "test_list": [{"input": "4\n5\n231\n7\n2323\n6\n333\n24\n133321333\n", "output": ["25\n1438\n1101\n686531475\n"]}, {"input": "9\n1500\n1212\n1500\n1221\n1500\n122\n1500\n12121\n1500\n22\n1500\n1111112111111112\n1500\n1111111111221111111\n1500\n111111122\n1500\n11111121111121111111\n", "output": ["1504\n1599\n1502\n1598\n1502\n1510\n1657\n1502\n1763\n"]}, {"input": "1\n1000000\n22\n", "output": ["1000002\n"]}, {"input": "1\n1000000\n221\n", "output": ["1001822\n"]}, {"input": "1\n1000000\n1221\n", "output": ["1001823\n"]}, {"input": "1\n1000000\n2121\n", "output": ["1001821\n"]}, {"input": "1\n1000000\n2211\n", "output": ["1002004\n"]}, {"input": "1\n1000000\n1212\n", "output": ["1000004\n"]}, {"input": "1\n1000000\n2112\n", "output": ["1000006\n"]}], "starter_code": "", "source_codes": ["\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\ndef process_string(x, s):\n    s = list(map(int, list(s)))\n    length = len(s)\n    i = 0\n    while i < x:\n        i += 1\n        length = (length + (s[i-1] - 1) * (length - i)) % MOD\n        if len(s) < x:\n            s += s[i:] * (s[i-1] - 1)\n    return length\n\n# Read the number of test cases\nt = int(input())\n\n# Process each test case\nfor _ in range(t):\n    x = int(input())\n    s = input()\n    print(process_string(x, s))\n\n\n"], "responses": ["```python\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\ndef process_string(x, s):\n    s = list(map(int, list(s)))\n    length = len(s)\n    i = 0\n    while i < x:\n        i += 1\n        length = (length + (s[i-1] - 1) * (length - i)) % MOD\n        if len(s) < x:\n            s += s[i:] * (s[i-1] - 1)\n    return length\n\n# Read the number of test cases\nt = int(input())\n\n# Process each test case\nfor _ in range(t):\n    x = int(input())\n    s = input()\n    print(process_string(x, s))\n```"], "prompt_tokens": [2939], "completion_tokens": [153], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": false, "language": "Python3", "task_id": 2183}

{"name": "2095", "description": "A tree is an undirected connected graph without cycles.\n\nLet's consider a rooted undirected tree with n vertices, numbered 1 through n. There are many ways to represent such a tree. One way is to create an array with n integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_{n}, where p_{i} denotes a parent of vertex i (here, for convenience a root is considered its own parent). [Image] For this rooted tree the array p is [2, 3, 3, 2]. \n\nGiven a sequence p_1, p_2, ..., p_{n}, one is able to restore a tree:  There must be exactly one index r that p_{r} = r. A vertex r is a root of the tree.  For all other n - 1 vertices i, there is an edge between vertex i and vertex p_{i}. \n\nA sequence p_1, p_2, ..., p_{n} is called valid if the described procedure generates some (any) rooted tree. For example, for n = 3 sequences (1,2,2), (2,3,1) and (2,1,3) are not valid.\n\nYou are given a sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}, not necessarily valid. Your task is to change the minimum number of elements, in order to get a valid sequence. Print the minimum number of changes and an example of a valid sequence after that number of changes. If there are many valid sequences achievable in the minimum number of changes, print any of them.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains an integer n (2 \u2264 n \u2264 200 000)\u00a0\u2014 the number of vertices in the tree.\n\nThe second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 \u2264 a_{i} \u2264 n).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIn the first line print the minimum number of elements to change, in order to get a valid sequence.\n\nIn the second line, print any valid sequence possible to get from (a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}) in the minimum number of changes.

The $i$-th box contains $n_i$ integer numbers. The integers can be negative. All of the integers are distinct. \n\nUjan is lazy, so he will do the following reordering of the numbers exactly once. He will pick a single integer from each of the boxes, $k$ integers in total. Then he will insert the chosen numbers\u00a0\u2014 one integer in each of the boxes, so that the number of integers in each box is the same as in the beginning.

Unfortunately, the teachers were too busy writing tasks for Codeforces rounds, and had no time to make an actual test. So, they just put one question in the test that is worth all the points.\n\nThere are n integers written on a row. Karen must alternately add and subtract each pair of adjacent integers, and write down the sums or differences on the next row. She must repeat this process on the values on the next row, and so on, until only one integer remains.

The rows are numbered $1$ to $4$ from top to bottom and the columns are numbered $1$ to $n$ from left to right.\n\nIn the first and last line, an integer $1 \\le x \\le k$ represents a parking spot assigned to car $x$ (you can only move this car to this place), while the integer $0$ represents a empty space (you can't move any car to this place).\n\nIn the second and third line, an integer $1 \\le x \\le k$ represents initial position of car $x$, while the integer $0$ represents an empty space (you can move any car to this place).\n\nEach $x$ between $1$ and $k$ appears exactly once in the second and third line, and exactly once in the first and fourth line.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIf there is a sequence of moves that brings all of the cars to their parking spaces, with at most $20000$ car moves, then print $m$, the number of moves, on the first line. On the following $m$ lines, print the moves (one move per line) in the format $i$ $r$ $c$, which corresponds to Allen moving car $i$ to the neighboring space at row $r$ and column $c$.\n\nIf it is not possible for Allen to move all the cars to the correct spaces with at most $20000$ car moves, print a single line with the integer $-1$.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n4 5\n1 2 0 4\n1 2 0 4\n5 0 0 3\n0 5 0 3\n\nOutput\n6\n1 1 1\n2 1 2\n4 1 4\n3 4 4\n5 3 2\n5 4 2\n\nInput\n1 2\n1\n2\n1\n2\n\nOutput\n-1\n\nInput\n1 2\n1\n1\n2\n2\n\nOutput\n2\n1 1 1\n2 4 1\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample test case, all cars are in front of their spots except car $5$, which is in front of the parking spot adjacent. The example shows the shortest possible sequence of moves, but any sequence of length at most $20000$ will be accepted.\n\nIn the second sample test case, there is only one column, and the cars are in the wrong order, so no cars can move and the task is impossible.", "difficulty": "competition", "id": 2047, "sample_io": [{"input": "4 5\n1 2 0 4\n1 2 0 4\n5 0 0 3\n0 5 0 3\n", "output": ["6\n1 1 1\n2 1 2\n4 1 4\n3 4 4\n5 3 2\n5 4 2\n"]}, {"input": "1 2\n1\n2\n1\n2\n", "output": ["-1\n"]}], "test_list": [{"input": "4 5\n1 2 0 4\n1 2 0 4\n5 0 0 3\n0 5 0 3\n", "output": ["6\n1 1 1\n2 1 2\n4 1 4\n3 4 4\n5 3 2\n5 4 2\n"]}, {"input": "1 2\n1\n2\n1\n2\n", "output": ["-1\n"]}, {"input": "1 2\n1\n1\n2\n2\n", "output": ["2\n1 1 1\n2 4 1\n"]}, {"input": "2 2\n1 0\n0 2\n0 1\n0 2\n", "output": ["7\n2 2 1\n1 2 2\n2 3 1\n1 2 1\n2 3 2\n1 1 1\n2 4 2\n"]}, {"input": "7 14\n2 11 1 14 9 8 5\n12 6 7 1 10 2 3\n14 13 9 8 5 4 11\n13 6 4 3 12 7 10\n", "output": ["-1\n"]}, {"input": "2 1\n0 0\n0 0\n0 1\n0 1\n", "output": ["1\n1 4 2\n"]}, {"input": "2 3\n0 2\n0 1\n3 2\n3 1\n", "output": ["7\n1 2 1\n2 2 2\n3 4 1\n1 3 1\n2 1 2\n1 3 2\n1 4 2\n"]}, {"input": "1 1\n0\n1\n0\n1\n", "output": ["2\n1 3 1\n1 4 1\n"]}, {"input": "2 4\n3 4\n2 1\n3 4\n2 1\n", "output": ["-1\n"]}, {"input": "3 5\n2 1 5\n5 3 2\n4 0 1\n0 4 3\n", "output": ["18\n4 3 2\n5 3 1\n3 2 1\n2 2 2\n1 2 3\n4 4 2\n5 3 2\n3 3 1\n2 2 1\n1 2 2\n5 3 3\n3 3 2\n2 1 1\n1 1 2\n5 2 3\n3 3 3\n5 1 3\n3 4 3\n"]}, {"input": "10 1\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n", "output": ["1\n1 1 3\n"]}, {"input": "50 1\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n", "output": ["34\n1 3 27\n1 3 28\n1 3 29\n1 3 30\n1 3 31\n1 3 32\n1 3 33\n1 3 34\n1 3 35\n1 3 36\n1 3 37\n1 3 38\n1 3 39\n1 3 40\n1 3 41\n1 3 42\n1 3 43\n1 3 44\n1 3 45\n1 3 46\n1 3 47\n1 3 48\n1 3 49\n1 3 50\n1 2 50\n1 2 49\n1 2 48\n1 2 47\n1 2 46\n1 2 45\n1 2 44\n1 2 43\n1 2 42\n1 1 42\n"]}, {"input": "22 2\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0\n", "output": ["65\n2 2 13\n1 3 21\n2 2 12\n1 3 22\n2 2 11\n1 2 22\n2 2 10\n1 2 21\n2 2 9\n1 2 20\n2 2 8\n1 2 19\n2 2 7\n1 2 18\n2 2 6\n1 2 17\n2 2 5\n1 2 16\n2 2 4\n1 2 15\n2 2 3\n1 2 14\n2 2 2\n1 2 13\n2 2 1\n1 2 12\n2 3 1\n1 2 11\n2 3 2\n1 2 10\n2 3 3\n1 2 9\n2 3 4\n1 2 8\n2 3 5\n1 2 7\n2 3 6\n1 2 6\n2 3 7\n1 2 5\n2 3 8\n1 2 4\n2 3 9\n1 2 3\n2 3 10\n1 2 2\n2 3 11\n1 2 1\n2 3 12\n1 3 1\n2 3 13\n1 3 2\n2 3 14\n1 3 3\n2 3 15\n1 3 4\n2 3 16\n1 3 5\n2 3 17\n1 3 6\n2 3 18\n1 3 7\n2 4 18\n1 3 8\n1 4 8\n"]}, {"input": "12 3\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n2 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 1 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 3 0 2 0\n", "output": ["38\n1 3 11\n3 3 7\n2 3 2\n1 3 12\n3 3 8\n2 3 3\n1 2 12\n3 3 9\n2 3 4\n1 2 11\n3 4 9\n2 3 5\n1 2 10\n2 3 6\n1 2 9\n2 3 7\n1 2 8\n2 3 8\n1 2 7\n2 3 9\n1 2 6\n2 3 10\n1 2 5\n2 3 11\n1 2 4\n2 4 11\n1 2 3\n1 2 2\n1 2 1\n1 3 1\n1 3 2\n1 3 3\n1 3 4\n1 3 5\n1 3 6\n1 3 7\n1 3 8\n1 4 8\n"]}, {"input": "10 20\n18 9 4 5 12 14 16 1 15 20\n11 13 16 6 18 5 20 17 4 3\n12 9 15 14 8 10 2 19 1 7\n6 11 13 2 7 19 10 3 8 17\n", "output": ["-1\n"]}, {"input": "15 30\n20 24 17 13 26 8 5 6 27 14 18 22 25 2 15\n4 12 6 25 3 5 28 11 15 21 9 26 7 17 13\n19 20 24 16 2 23 8 29 22 30 1 27 10 14 18\n9 29 3 7 12 28 10 16 23 19 21 1 30 11 4\n", "output": ["-1\n"]}], "starter_code": "", "source_codes": ["\ndef park_cars(n, k, grid):\n    moves = []\n    #

{"name": "2026", "description": "Yaroslav is playing a game called \"Time\". The game has a timer showing the lifespan he's got left. As soon as the timer shows 0, Yaroslav's character dies and the game ends. Also, the game has n clock stations, station number i is at point (x_{i}, y_{i}) of the plane. As the player visits station number i, he increases the current time on his timer by a_{i}. The stations are for one-time use only, so if the player visits some station another time, the time on his timer won't grow.\n\nA player spends d\u00b7dist time units to move between stations, where dist is the distance the player has covered and d is some constant. The distance between stations i and j is determined as |x_{i} - x_{j}| + |y_{i} - y_{j}|.\n\nInitially, the player is at station number 1, and the player has strictly more than zero and strictly less than one units of time. At station number 1 one unit of money can increase the time on the timer by one time unit (you can buy only integer number of time units).\n\nNow Yaroslav is wondering, how much money he needs to get to station n. Help Yaroslav.

{"name": "2159", "description": "Polycarp is making a quest for his friends. He has already made n tasks, for each task the boy evaluated how interesting it is as an integer q_{i}, and the time t_{i} in minutes needed to complete the task. \n\nAn interesting feature of his quest is: each participant should get the task that is best suited for him, depending on his preferences. The task is chosen based on an interactive quiz that consists of some questions. The player should answer these questions with \"yes\" or \"no\". Depending on the answer to the question, the participant either moves to another question or goes to one of the tasks that are in the quest. In other words, the quest is a binary tree, its nodes contain questions and its leaves contain tasks. \n\nWe know that answering any of the questions that are asked before getting a task takes exactly one minute from the quest player. Polycarp knows that his friends are busy people and they can't participate in the quest for more than T minutes. Polycarp wants to choose some of the n tasks he made, invent the corresponding set of questions for them and use them to form an interactive quiz as a binary tree so that no matter how the player answers quiz questions, he spends at most T minutes on completing the whole quest (that is, answering all the questions and completing the task). Specifically, the quest can contain zero questions and go straight to the task. Each task can only be used once (i.e., the people who give different answers to questions should get different tasks).\n\nPolycarp wants the total \"interest\" value of the tasks involved in the quest to be as large as possible.

{"name": "2066", "description": "In the official contest this problem has a different statement, for which jury's solution was working incorrectly, and for this reason it was excluded from the contest. This mistake have been fixed and the current given problem statement and model solution corresponds to what jury wanted it to be during the contest.\n\nVova and Lesha are friends. They often meet at Vova's place and compete against each other in a computer game named The Ancient Papyri: Swordsink. Vova always chooses a warrior as his fighter and Leshac chooses an archer. After that they should choose initial positions for their characters and start the fight. A warrior is good at melee combat, so Vova will try to make the distance between fighters as small as possible. An archer prefers to keep the enemy at a distance, so Lesha will try to make the initial distance as large as possible.\n\nThere are n (n is always even) possible starting positions for characters marked along the Ox axis. The positions are given by their distinct coordinates x_1, x_2, ..., x_{n}, two characters cannot end up at the same position.\n\nVova and Lesha take turns banning available positions, Vova moves first. During each turn one of the guys bans exactly one of the remaining positions. Banned positions cannot be used by both Vova and Lesha.

Curiously enough, the beliefs of the inhabitants require the time needed to pass each road to be equal either to $a$ or $b$ seconds. It's guaranteed that one can go between any pair of settlements by following a sequence of roads.\n\nCodefortia was recently struck by the financial crisis. Therefore, the king decided to abandon some of the roads so that:\n\n  it will be possible to travel between each pair of cities using the remaining roads only,  the sum of times required to pass each remaining road will be minimum possible (in other words, remaining roads must form minimum spanning tree, using the time to pass the road as its weight),  among all the plans minimizing the sum of times above, the time required to travel between the king's residence (in settlement $1$) and the parliament house (in settlement $p$) using the remaining roads only will be minimum possible. \n\nThe king, however, forgot where the parliament house was.

{"name": "2065", "description": "Andrewid the Android is a galaxy-famous detective. He is now investigating the case of vandalism at the exhibition of contemporary art.\n\nThe main exhibit is a construction of n matryoshka dolls that can be nested one into another. The matryoshka dolls are numbered from 1 to n. A matryoshka with a smaller number can be nested in a matryoshka with a higher number, two matryoshkas can not be directly nested in the same doll, but there may be chain nestings, for example, 1 \u2192 2 \u2192 4 \u2192 5. \n\nIn one second, you can perform one of the two following operations:  Having a matryoshka a that isn't nested in any other matryoshka and a matryoshka b, such that b doesn't contain any other matryoshka and is not nested in any other matryoshka, you may put a in b;  Having a matryoshka a directly contained in matryoshka b, such that b is not nested in any other matryoshka, you may get a out of b. \n\nAccording to the modern aesthetic norms the matryoshka dolls on display were assembled in a specific configuration, i.e. as several separate chains of nested matryoshkas, but the criminal, following the mysterious plan, took out all the dolls and assembled them into a single large chain (1 \u2192 2 \u2192 ... \u2192 n). In order to continue the investigation Andrewid needs to know in what minimum time it is possible to perform this action.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains integers n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5) and k (1 \u2264 k \u2264 10^5) \u2014 the number of matryoshkas and matryoshka chains in the initial configuration.\n\nThe next k lines contain the descriptions of the chains: the i-th line first contains number m_{i} (1 \u2264 m_{i} \u2264 n), and then m_{i} numbers a_{i}1, a_{i}2, ..., a_{im}_{i} \u2014 the numbers of matryoshkas in the chain (matryoshka a_{i}1 is nested into matryoshka a_{i}2, that is nested into matryoshka a_{i}3, and so on till the matryoshka a_{im}_{i} that isn't nested into any other matryoshka).\n\nIt is guaranteed that m_1 + m_2 + ... + m_{k} = n, the numbers of matryoshkas in all the chains are distinct, in each chain the numbers of matryoshkas follow in the ascending order.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIn the single line print the minimum number of seconds needed to assemble one large chain from the initial configuration.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3 2\n2 1 2\n1 3\n\nOutput\n1\n\nInput\n7 3\n3 1 3 7\n2 2 5\n2 4 6\n\nOutput\n10\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample test there are two chains: 1 \u2192 2 and 3. In one second you can nest the first chain into the second one and get 1 \u2192 2 \u2192 3.\n\nIn the second sample test you need to disassemble all the three chains into individual matryoshkas in 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 seconds and then assemble one big chain in 6 seconds.", "difficulty": "competition", "id": 2065, "sample_io": [{"input": "3 2\n2 1 2\n1 3\n", "output": ["1\n"]}, {"input": "7 3\n3 1 3 7\n2 2 5\n2 4 6\n", "output": ["10\n"]}], "test_list": [{"input": "3 2\n2 1 2\n1 3\n", "output": ["1\n"]}, {"input": "7 3\n3 1 3 7\n2 2 5\n2 4 6\n", "output": ["10\n"]}, {"input": "1 1\n1 1\n", "output": ["0\n"]}, {"input": "3 2\n1 2\n2 1 3\n", "output": ["3\n"]}, {"input": "5 3\n1 4\n3 1 2 3\n1 5\n", "output": ["2\n"]}, {"input": "8 5\n2 1 2\n2 3 4\n1 5\n2 6 7\n1 8\n", "output": ["8\n"]}, {"input": "10 10\n1 5\n1 4\n1 10\n1 3\n1 7\n1 1\n1 8\n1 6\n1 9\n1 2\n", "output": ["9\n"]}, {"input": "20 6\n3 8 9 13\n3 4 14 20\n2 15 17\n3 2 5 11\n5 7 10 12 18 19\n4 1 3 6 16\n", "output": ["33\n"]}, {"input": "50 10\n6 17 21 31 42 45 49\n6 11 12 15 22 26 38\n3 9 29 36\n3 10 23 43\n5 14 19 28 46 48\n2 30 39\n6 13 20 24 33 37 47\n8 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\n7 16 18 25 27 34 40 44\n4 32 35 41 50\n", "output": ["75\n"]}, {"input": "13 8\n1 5\n2 8 10\n1 13\n4 1 2 3 11\n1 7\n2 6 12\n1 4\n1 9\n", "output": ["13\n"]}, {"input": "21 13\n1 18\n2 8 13\n1 21\n1 17\n2 7 9\n1 20\n1 19\n1 4\n1 16\n2 5 6\n3 12 14 15\n3 1 2 3\n2 10 11\n", "output": ["24\n"]}, {"input": "50 50\n1 2\n1 5\n1 28\n1 46\n1 42\n1 24\n1 3\n1 37\n1 33\n1 50\n1 23\n1 40\n1 43\n1 26\n1 49\n1 34\n1 8\n1 45\n1 15\n1 1\n1 22\n1 18\n1 27\n1 25\n1 13\n1 39\n1 38\n1 10\n1 44\n1 6\n1 17\n1 47\n1 7\n1 35\n1 20\n1 36\n1 31\n1 21\n1 32\n1 29\n1 4\n1 12\n1 19\n1 16\n1 11\n1 41\n1 9\n1 14\n1 30\n1 48\n", "output": ["49\n"]}, {"input": "100 3\n45 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 19 21 24 27 28 30 34 35 37 39 40 41 42 43 46 47 48 51 52 55 58 59 61 63 64 66 69 71 76 80 85 86 88 89 94 99\n26 10 11 15 18 23 29 31 33 36 38 44 49 54 56 60 62 65 75 78 82 83 84 95 96 97 98\n29 12 13 14 16 17 20 22 25 26 32 45 50 53 57 67 68 70 72 73 74 77 79 81 87 90 91 92 93 100\n", "output": ["180\n"]}, {"input": "100 19\n6 62 72 83 91 94 97\n3 61 84 99\n1 63\n5 46 53 56 69 78\n5 41 43 49 74 89\n5 55 57 79 85 87\n3 47 59 98\n3 64 76 82\n3 48 66 75\n2 60 88\n2 67 77\n4 40 51 73 95\n41 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 44 71 81\n4 58 65 90 93\n1 100\n5 39 45 52 80 86\n2 50 68\n1 92\n4 42 54 70 96\n", "output": ["106\n"]}], "starter_code": "", "source_codes": ["\ndef min_time_to_assemble(n, k, chains):\n    # Initialize the time to 0\n    time = 0\n    # Check if the first chain starts with 1 and is in correct order\n    if chains[0][0] == 1:\n        # Count the number of correct matryoshkas in the first chain\n        correct = 1\n        for i in range(1, len(chains[0])):\n            if chains[0][i] == chains[0][i-1] + 1:\n                correct += 1\n            else:\n                break\n        # Subtract the number of correct matryoshkas from n\n        # because we don't need to disassemble and reassemble them\n        n -= correct\n    # Each remaining matryoshka needs to be disassembled and then reassembled\n    # which takes 2 seconds per matryoshka\n    time += 2 * n\n    # Subtract k because we save one second for each chain when reassembling\n    time -= k\n    return time\n\n# Read input\nn, k = map(int, input().split())\nchains = []\nfor _ in range(k):\n    chain = list(map(int, input().split()))[1:]  # Skip the first number as it's the length of the chain\n    chains.append(chain)\n\n# Calculate and print the result\nprint(min_time_to_assemble(n, k, chains))\n\n\n"], "responses": ["```python\ndef min_time_to_assemble(n, k, chains):\n    # Initialize the time to 0\n    time = 0\n    # Check if the first chain starts with 1 and is in correct order\n    if chains[0][0] == 1:\n        # Count the number of correct matryoshkas in the first chain\n        correct = 1\n        for i in range(1, len(chains[0])):\n            if chains[0][i] == chains[0][i-1] + 1:\n                correct += 1\n            else:\n                break\n        # Subtract the number of correct matryoshkas from n\n        # because we don't need to disassemble and reassemble them\n        n -= correct\n    # Each remaining matryoshka needs to be disassembled and then reassembled\n    # which takes 2 seconds per matryoshka\n    time += 2 * n\n    # Subtract k because we save one second for each chain when reassembling\n    time -= k\n    return time\n\n# Read input\nn, k = map(int, input().split())\nchains = []\nfor _ in range(k):\n    chain = list(map(int, input().split()))[1:]  # Skip the first number as it's the length of the chain\n    chains.append(chain)\n\n# Calculate and print the result\nprint(min_time_to_assemble(n, k, chains))\n```"], "prompt_tokens": [2380], "completion_tokens": [307], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": false, "language": "Python3", "task_id": 2065}
{"name": "2198", "description": "There are some ambiguities when one writes Berland names with the letters of the Latin alphabet.\n\nFor example, the Berland sound u can be written in the Latin alphabet as \"u\", and can be written as \"oo\". For this reason, two words \"ulyana\" and \"oolyana\" denote the same name.\n\nThe second ambiguity is about the Berland sound h: one can use both \"h\" and \"kh\" to write it. For example, the words \"mihail\" and \"mikhail\" denote the same name.\n\nThere are n users registered on the Polycarp's website. Each of them indicated a name represented by the Latin letters. How many distinct names are there among them, if two ambiguities described above are taken into account?\n\nFormally, we assume that two words denote the same name, if using the replacements \"u\"\u00a0[Image]\u00a0\"oo\" and \"h\"\u00a0[Image]\u00a0\"kh\", you can make the words equal. One can make replacements in both directions, in any of the two words an arbitrary number of times. A letter that resulted from the previous replacement can participate in the next replacements.\n\nFor example, the following pairs of words denote the same name:  \"koouper\" and \"kuooper\". Making the replacements described above, you can make both words to be equal: \"koouper\" $\\rightarrow$ \"kuuper\" and \"kuooper\" $\\rightarrow$ \"kuuper\".  \"khun\" and \"kkkhoon\". With the replacements described above you can make both words to be equal: \"khun\" $\\rightarrow$ \"khoon\" and \"kkkhoon\" $\\rightarrow$ \"kkhoon\" $\\rightarrow$ \"khoon\". \n\nFor a given list of words, find the minimal number of groups where the words in each group denote the same name.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains integer number n (2 \u2264 n \u2264 400) \u2014 number of the words in the list.\n\nThe following n lines contain words, one word per line.

{"name": "1604", "description": "You are at the top left cell $(1, 1)$ of an $n \\times m$ labyrinth. Your goal is to get to the bottom right cell $(n, m)$. You can only move right or down, one cell per step. Moving right from a cell $(x, y)$ takes you to the cell $(x, y + 1)$, while moving down takes you to the cell $(x + 1, y)$.\n\nSome cells of the labyrinth contain rocks. When you move to a cell with rock, the rock is pushed to the next cell in the direction you're moving. If the next cell contains a rock, it gets pushed further, and so on.\n\nThe labyrinth is surrounded by impenetrable walls, thus any move that would put you or any rock outside of the labyrinth is illegal.\n\nCount the number of different legal paths you can take from the start to the goal modulo $10^9 + 7$.

{"name": "2060", "description": "Evlampiy has found one more cool application to process photos. However the application has certain limitations.\n\nEach photo i has a contrast v_{i}. In order for the processing to be truly of high quality, the application must receive at least k photos with contrasts which differ as little as possible.\n\nEvlampiy already knows the contrast v_{i} for each of his n photos. Now he wants to split the photos into groups, so that each group contains at least k photos. As a result, each photo must belong to exactly one group.\n\nHe considers a processing time of the j-th group to be the difference between the maximum and minimum values of v_{i} in the group. Because of multithreading the processing time of a division into groups is the maximum processing time among all groups.\n\nSplit n photos into groups in a such way that the processing time of the division is the minimum possible, i.e. that the the maximum processing time over all groups as least as possible.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and k (1 \u2264 k \u2264 n \u2264 3\u00b710^5) \u2014 number of photos and minimum size of a group.\n\nThe second line contains n integers v_1, v_2, ..., v_{n} (1 \u2264 v_{i} \u2264 10^9), where v_{i} is the contrast of the i-th photo.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint the minimal processing time of the division into groups.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n5 2\n50 110 130 40 120\n\nOutput\n20\n\nInput\n4 1\n2 3 4 1\n\nOutput\n0\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example the photos should be split into 2 groups: [40, 50] and [110, 120, 130]. The processing time of the first group is 10, and the processing time of the second group is 20. Maximum among 10 and 20 is 20. It is impossible to split the photos into groups in a such way that the processing time of division is less than 20.\n\nIn the second example the photos should be split into four groups, each containing one photo.
