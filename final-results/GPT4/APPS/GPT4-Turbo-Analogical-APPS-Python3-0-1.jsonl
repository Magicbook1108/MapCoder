{"name": "3554", "description": "Zonk is addictive dice game. In each round player rolls 6 dice. Then (s)he composes combinations from them. Each combination gives certain points. \n\nThen player can take one or more dice combinations to his hand and re-roll remaining dice or save his score. Dice in player's hand won't be taken into account in subsequent rolls.\n\nIf no combinations can be composed - situation is called \"zonk\". Player thrown zonk loses all points in this round and next player moves. So it's player decision when to reroll and when to stop and save his score.\n\nYour task is simple - just evaluate current roll and return maximum number of points can be scored from it. If no combinations can be made - function must return string ``\"Zonk\"`` (without quotes).\n\nThere are different variations of Zonk. In this kata, we will use most common table of combinations:\n\nCombinationExample rollPoints\nStraight (1,2,3,4,5 and 6)6 3 1 2 5 41000 points\nThree pairs of any dice2 2 4 4 1 1750 points\nThree of 11 4 1 11000 points\nThree of 22 3 4 2 2200 points\nThree of 33 4 3 6 3 2300 points\nThree of 44 4 4400 points\nThree of 52 5 5 5 4500 points\nThree of 66 6 2 6600 points\nFour of a kind1 1 1 1 4 62 \u00d7 Three-of-a-kind score (in example, 2000 pts)\nFive of a kind5 5 5 4 5 53 \u00d7 Three-of-a-kind score (in example, 1500 pts)\nSix of a kind4 4 4 4 4 44 \u00d7 Three-of-a-kind score (in example, 1600 pts)\nEvery 14 3 1 2 2100 points\nEvery 55 2 650 points\n\n\nEach die cannot be used in multiple combinations the same time, so three pairs of 2, 3 and 5 will worth you only ``750`` points (for three pairs), not 850 (for three pairs and two fives). But you can select multiple combinations, ``2 2 2 1 6`` will worth you ``300`` points (200 for three-of-kind '2' plus 100 for single '1' die)\n\nExamples:\n```python\n  get_score([1,2,3]) # returns 100 = points from one 1\n  get_score([3,4,1,1,5]) # returns 250 = points from two 1 and one 5\n  get_score([2,3,2,3,3,2]) # returns 500 = three of 2 + three of 3\n  get_score([1,1,1,1,1,5]) # returns 3050 = five 1 + one 5\n  get_score([2,3,4,3,6,6]) # returns \"Zonk\" = no combinations here\n  get_score([2,2,6,6,2,2]) # returns 400 = four 2, this cannot be scored as three pairs\n  get_score([1,3,4,3,4,1]) # returns 750 = three pairs\n  get_score([3,3,3,3]) # returns 600 = four of 3\n  get_score([1,2,3,4,5]) # returns 150 = it's not straight\n```\nOf course, in real Zonk game it's sometimes not worth to collect all combination from roll. Taking less dice and rerolling more remaining may be better, but task is just to calculate maximum possible score from current single roll.\n\nP.S.

We need to count the occurrences of each die value and then match these counts against the scoring rules to calculate the maximum score. This involves iterating through the dice values, counting them, and then applying the rules to determine the score.\n\n## Tutorial:\nCounting and pattern matching are common techniques in competitive programming, especially in problems that involve analyzing sequences or sets of items.\n\n1. **Counting**: This is the process of determining the frequency of each unique element in a collection. In Python, this can be easily done using a dictionary or the `collections.Counter` class.\n\n2. **Pattern Matching**: Once we have the counts of each element, we need to match these counts against a set of rules or patterns to determine the outcome. This often involves if-else statements or switch-case logic to apply the correct rule based on the counts.\n\nTo implement these concepts in Python:\n\n- Use a `Counter` from the `collections` module to count the occurrences of each die value.\n- Check for the highest scoring combinations first, as they will use the most dice and typically yield the highest scores.\n- Once a combination is used, remove those dice from consideration for further combinations.\n- Continue checking for combinations until no more can be made, then sum the scores for the final result.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Yahtzee Score Calculator**: Given a list of dice rolls, calculate the maximum Yahtzee score. The solution involves counting the occurrences of each die value and then applying the Yahtzee scoring rules.\n\n2. **Poker Hand Ranking**: Given a set of poker cards, determine the rank of the hand (e.g., pair, two pairs, three of a kind, etc.). This involves counting the occurrences of each card rank and then matching them to the hand ranking rules.\n\n3. **Scrabble Score Calculator**: Given a word, calculate the Scrabble score. Each letter has a point value, and the score is the sum of the point values of the letters in the word. This involves counting the occurrences of each letter and then multiplying by the corresponding point values.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef get_score(dice):\n    # Scoring rules in descending order of priority\n    scoring_rules = [\n        (lambda x: len(x) == 6 and len(set(x)) == 6, 1000),  # Straight\n        (lambda x: len(x) == 6 and all(x.count(d) == 2 for d in set(x)), 750),  # Three pairs\n        (lambda x: 3 in x.values(), lambda x: x.most_common(1)[0][0] * 100 * (3 if x.most_common(1)[0][0] != 1 else 10)),  # Three of a kind\n        (lambda x: 4 in x.values(), lambda x: x.most_common(1)[0][0] * 100 * 2 * (3 if x.most_common(1)[0][0] != 1 else 10)),  # Four of a kind\n        (lambda x: 5 in x.values(), lambda x: x.most_common(1)[0][0] * 100 * 3 * (3 if x.most_common(1)[0][0] != 1 else 10)),  # Five of a kind\n        (lambda x: 6 in x.values(), lambda x: x.most_common(1)[0][0] * 100 * 4 * (3 if x.most_common(1)[0][0] != 1 else 10)),  # Six of a kind\n        (lambda x: x[1] > 0, lambda x: x[1] * 100),  # Each 1\n        (lambda x: x[5] > 0, lambda x: x[5] * 50),   # Each 5\n    ]\n    \n    # Count the occurrences of each die value\n    counts = Counter(dice)\n    \n    # Initialize score\n    score = 0\n    \n    # Apply scoring rules\n    for rule, points in scoring_rules:\n        if callable(points):\n            if rule(counts):\n                score += points(counts)\n                counts.subtract(Counter({counts.most_common(1)[0][0]: 3}))\n        else:\n            if rule(counts):\n                score += points\n                return score  # Straight or three pairs are exclusive\n    \n    return score if score > 0 else \"Zonk\"\n\n# Read input, call the function and print the output\ndice = list(map(int, input().strip().split(',')))\nprint(get_score(dice))\n```\n\nThis code defines the scoring rules and uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each die value.

Here are the key methods we'll use:\n\n- `split()`: This method splits a string into a list of words based on a delimiter (default is any whitespace).\n- `capitalize()`: This method returns a copy of the string with its first character capitalized and the rest lowercased.\n- `join()`: This method joins the elements of an iterable (like a list of words) into a single string, with a specified string as the separator.\n\nWhen solving problems that involve string manipulation, it's important to consider edge cases such as leading and trailing spaces, multiple spaces between words, and words that are already capitalized.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Title Case a Sentence**: Given a sentence, write a function that capitalizes the first letter of each word in the sentence.\n   Solution: Similar to the original problem, we split the sentence into words, capitalize each word, and join them back together.\n\n2. **CamelCase Conversion**: Given a series of words separated by spaces or underscores, write a function that converts them into camelCase.\n   Solution: Split the string by spaces or underscores, capitalize the first letter of each word except the first one, and join them without spaces.\n\n3. **Acronym Generator**: Given a phrase, write a function that returns the acronym of the phrase by taking the first letter of each word and capitalizing it.\n   Solution: Split the phrase into words, take the first letter of each word, capitalize it, and join them together without spaces.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\nWe will define a function `drop_cap` that takes a string as input.

The problem can be solved using a brute-force approach combined with some string manipulation techniques.\n\n## Tutorial:\nA palindrome is a string that reads the same forward and backward. To check if a string is a palindrome, we can compare characters from the beginning and the end of the string moving towards the center.\n\nFor this problem, we need to consider each character in the string and generate two possible characters (except for 'a' and 'z', which have only one possible change). Then, we need to generate all possible combinations of these changes to form new strings. After generating all possible strings, we check if any of them is a palindrome.\n\nTo generate all possible strings, we can use a recursive function that takes the current index and the current string as parameters. At each step, the function will generate two new strings (if possible) by changing the current character and recursively call itself with the next index.\n\nTo check if a string is a palindrome, we can use a two-pointer approach where one pointer starts from the beginning of the string and the other from the end. We move both pointers towards the center, comparing the characters they point to at each step. If all pairs of characters are equal, the string is a palindrome.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Palindrome Checker**: Given a string, determine if it is a palindrome. The solution involves comparing characters from both ends of the string moving towards the center.\n\n2. **Next Palindrome**: Given a number, find the smallest palindrome larger than this number. The solution involves generating the next higher number and checking if it's a palindrome until we find the next palindrome.\n\n3. **Longest Palindromic Substring**: Given a string, find the longest palindromic substring in it. The solution involves expanding around each character and checking for palindromes, keeping track of the longest one found.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\nWe will write a function `is_palindrome` to check if a given string is a palindrome.

The nth term of an AP can be calculated using the formula:\n\n`a_n = a_1 + (n - 1) * d`\n\nwhere `a_n` is the nth term, `a_1` is the first term, and `d` is the common difference.\n\nThe sum of the first n terms of an AP is given by:\n\n`S_n = n/2 * (2 * a_1 + (n - 1) * d)`\n\nor\n\n`S_n = n/2 * (a_1 + a_n)`\n\nIn the context of this problem, each row represents an arithmetic progression where the first term of the Nth row is the sum of the first (N-1) natural numbers plus 1, and the common difference is 1. The sum of the Nth row is simply the sum of N terms of this AP.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Fibonacci Sequence**: Given a number N, find the Nth Fibonacci number. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where a number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. This is not an arithmetic progression, but it is another example of a sequence with a pattern that can be solved with a formula.\n\n2. **Sum of Squares**: Given a number N, calculate the sum of the squares of the first N natural numbers. This problem can be solved using the formula for the sum of squares of an arithmetic progression.\n\n3. **Arithmetic Slices**: A sequence of numbers is called arithmetic if it consists of at least three elements and if the difference between any two consecutive elements is the same. Given an array of integers, the task is to count the number of arithmetic slices in the array.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\nTo find the sum of the Nth row, we first need to find the first number in the Nth row.

In Python, this can be done using built-in methods such as `isdigit()` to check if a string contains only digits, and using the `len()` function to check the length of the string.\n\nHere's a brief tutorial on these methods:\n\n- `str.isdigit()`: This method returns `True` if all characters in the string are digits and there is at least one character, otherwise `False`. For example, `'1234'.isdigit()` returns `True`, while `'123a'.isdigit()` returns `False`.\n\n- `len(s)`: This function returns the length of the given string `s`.

Recursion is a method where the solution to a problem depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem. In the case of the Hofstadter Q sequence, each term is defined in terms of previous terms in the sequence, making it a perfect candidate for a recursive approach.\n\n## Tutorial:\nRecursion involves a function calling itself with a different argument until it reaches a base case, which is a condition where the function can return a result without calling itself. In recursive sequences like the Hofstadter Q sequence, the base case is usually the initial terms of the sequence.\n\nTo implement a recursive function for the Hofstadter Q sequence, you need to follow these steps:\n1. Define the base cases. For the Hofstadter Q sequence, the first two terms are both 1.\n2. Write the recursive case according to the definition of the sequence. For Hofstadter Q, Q(n) = Q(n - Q(n - 1)) + Q(n - Q(n - 2)).\n3. Ensure that the recursive calls are moving towards the base case to avoid infinite recursion.\n\nIt's important to note that naive recursion can be inefficient for sequences like Hofstadter Q because it may recompute the same terms multiple times. To improve efficiency, memoization can be used, which stores the results of expensive function calls and returns the cached result when the same inputs occur again.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Fibonacci Sequence**: The Fibonacci sequence is a famous recursive sequence where each term is the sum of the two preceding ones. The problem is to find the nth Fibonacci number. The solution involves a recursive function with base cases for the first two terms (0 and 1) and a recursive case that adds the two previous Fibonacci numbers.\n\n2. **Factorial**: The factorial of a number n is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n. The problem is to calculate the factorial of a given number. The solution uses a recursive function with a base case for 0! (which is 1) and a recursive case that multiplies the number by the factorial of the number minus one.\n\n3. **Tower of Hanoi**: The Tower of Hanoi is a mathematical puzzle where the objective is to move a stack of disks from one rod to another, following certain rules. The problem can be solved using recursion by moving n-1 disks to a temporary rod, then moving the nth disk to the target rod, and finally moving the n-1 disks from the temporary rod to the target rod.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\nTo solve the Hofstadter Q sequence problem, we will implement a recursive function with memoization.

The algorithm involves finding this pattern and using it to determine the last digit of the nth Fibonacci number without having to calculate the entire sequence.\n\n## Tutorial:\nThe Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1. In this problem, we start with 1 and 1. The sequence goes 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, and so on.\n\nA brute force approach to find the nth Fibonacci number's last digit would be to calculate the entire sequence up to the nth number. However, this is not efficient for large n, as the numbers grow exponentially.\n\nInstead, we can take advantage of a property of the Fibonacci sequence: the last digits repeat in a cycle known as Pisano period. For the base 10 number system, the Pisano period is 60, meaning the last digits of Fibonacci numbers repeat every 60 numbers.\n\nKnowing this, we can calculate the last digit of the nth Fibonacci number by finding the remainder of n divided by 60 (n % 60) and then determining the last digit of the Fibonacci number at that position in the cycle.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Finding the nth Fibonacci Number**: Given n, calculate the nth Fibonacci number. The solution involves using a loop or recursion to build up to the nth number, or using the closed-form expression known as Binet's formula (not suitable for large n due to floating-point precision issues).\n\n2. **Sum of Fibonacci Numbers**: Given n, find the sum of the first n Fibonacci numbers. The solution can use the fact that the sum of the first n Fibonacci numbers is equal to the (n+2)th Fibonacci number minus 1.\n\n3. **Fibonacci Number Modulo m**: Given n and m, find the nth Fibonacci number modulo m. This problem can be solved using the Pisano period concept, where we first determine the length of the Pisano period for m, and then calculate the Fibonacci number at the position n % period length, finally taking the modulo m of that number.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\nWe will use the Pisano period property to find the last digit of the nth Fibonacci number.

This technique involves iterating over the string with two pointers, one for the string where we are searching (`str`) and another for the name (`name`). The goal is to find a subsequence in `str` that matches `name`.\n\n## Tutorial:\nThe two-pointer technique is a common approach in problems that involve sequences or arrays. The idea is to use two indices to traverse the sequence, which can help in various scenarios like searching for a pair of elements, merging two sorted arrays, or finding subsequences.\n\nIn this particular problem, we use the two-pointer technique to find if `name` is a subsequence of `str`. A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.\n\nHere's a step-by-step approach to solve the problem:\n1. Convert both strings to lowercase to make the search case-insensitive.\n2. Initialize two pointers, one at the start of `str` and one at the start of `name`.\n3. Iterate over `str` with the first pointer.\n4. For each character in `str`, if it matches the current character in `name` pointed by the second pointer, move the second pointer to the next character in `name`.\n5. If the second pointer reaches the end of `name`, it means all characters have been found in order, and we return `True`.\n6. If the first pointer reaches the end of `str` before the second pointer reaches the end of `name`, return `False`.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)**: Given two strings, find the length of the longest subsequence present in both of them. The solution involves dynamic programming to build a table that represents the LCS length for different substrings.\n\n2. **Subsequence Pattern Matching**: Given a string and a pattern, check if the pattern is a subsequence of the string. This is similar to our original problem but may not require the characters to be in order.\n\n3. **Minimum Window Substring**: Given two strings `s` and `t`, return the minimum window in `s` which will contain all the characters in `t`. This problem can be solved using a sliding window technique, which is a variation of the two-pointer technique.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\nWe will implement the two-pointer technique as described in the tutorial.

The algorithm involves iterating over two arrays simultaneously, comparing elements, and conditionally modifying or removing elements based on the comparison results.\n\n## Tutorial:\nArray manipulation is a fundamental concept in programming, which involves creating, accessing, and modifying the contents of arrays. In competitive programming, array manipulation is often used to solve problems that require data storage and direct access to elements.\n\nWhen iterating over two arrays simultaneously, you typically use a loop that runs until the end of the shorter array is reached. During each iteration, you compare the corresponding elements from both arrays and perform actions based on the comparison.\n\nIn the context of this problem, you need to compare the power and toughness of creatures represented by subarrays. The comparison involves checking if the power of one creature is greater than or equal to the toughness of the other creature, which would result in the death of the latter.\n\nHere are the steps to solve the problem:\n1. Initialize two lists to store the surviving creatures for player1 and player2.\n2. Iterate over both arrays of creatures using a loop.\n3.

The trial division method works by dividing the number `n` by the smallest prime number `p` (starting with 2) and continuing the division with `p` until `n` is no longer divisible by `p`.

We need to maintain a few variables to keep track of the current sequence of exclamation marks and question marks, as well as the longest sequence found so far.\n\nHere's a step-by-step approach:\n1. Initialize variables to keep track of the current sequence (`current_seq`) and the longest sequence (`longest_seq`).\n2. Iterate through each character in the string.\n3. If the current character is an exclamation mark or a question mark, add it to `current_seq`.\n4. If the current character breaks the sequence (i.e., it is not the same as the previous character and not a continuation of the sequence), check if `current_seq` is longer than `longest_seq`. If it is, update `longest_seq`.\n5. Reset `current_seq` if the sequence is broken.\n6. After the loop, return `longest_seq`.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Longest Palindromic Substring**: Given a string, find the longest palindromic substring in it.

The solution uses a stack to keep track of the opening brackets and ensures they match with the correct closing brackets.\n\n3. **String Compression**: Given an array of characters, compress it using the following algorithm: For each group of consecutive repeating characters in the original array, you need to replace it with the character followed by the length of the group.

Specifically, we need to:\n\n1. Iterate over each word in the sentence.\n2. Apply the appropriate transformation based on the rules provided.\n3. Reconstruct the sentence with the transformed words.\n\n## Tutorial:\nString manipulation is a common task in programming, where you are required to modify, extract, or analyze strings. In Python, strings are immutable, meaning that any operation that modifies a string will actually create a new string.\n\nTo solve problems like this, you often need to:\n\n- Split the string into individual words or tokens.\n- Apply some condition to decide how to transform each word.\n- Join the transformed words back into a single string.\n\nFor splitting a string into words, you can use the `split()` method, which will divide the string at every space by default. To join words back into a string, you can use the `join()` method, which concatenates a list of strings into a single string with a specified separator.\n\nConditional logic is used to apply different transformations based on the rules. In Python, you can use `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements to execute different blocks of code depending on the conditions.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Reverse Words in a String III** - Given a string, you must reverse the order of characters in each word within a sentence while still preserving whitespace and initial word order.\n   Solution: Iterate over each word, reverse it, and join them back together.\n   ```python\n   def reverseWords(s):\n       return ' '.join(word[::-1] for word in s.split())\n   ```\n\n2. **To Lower Case** - Given a string, convert it to lowercase.\n   Solution: Use the `lower()` method on the string.\n   ```python\n   def toLowerCase(str):\n       return str.lower()\n   ```\n\n3. **Valid Palindrome** - Given a string, determine if it is a palindrome, considering only alphanumeric characters and ignoring cases.\n   Solution: Filter out non-alphanumeric characters, convert to lowercase, and check if the string is equal to its reverse.\n   ```python\n   def isPalindrome(s):\n       filtered_chars = filter(str.isalnum, s)\n       lowercase_filtered = ''.join(filtered_chars).lower()\n       return lowercase_filtered == lowercase_filtered[::-1]\n   ```\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\n- We will iterate over each word in the input sentence.\n- For each word, we will check the conditions for transformation in the order given.\n- We will apply the first transformation that matches.\n- We will reconstruct the sentence with the transformed words.\n\n```python\ndef transform_word(word):\n    # Check if the word should be converted to \"0\"\n    if len(word) == 1 and word.isalpha():\n        return \"0\"\n    \n    # Check if the word should be reversed\n    if len(word.rstrip('.,!?')) > 6 or word.lower().count('t') >= 2:\n        # Keep punctuation at the end\n        if word[-1] in '.,!?':\n            return word[:-1][::-1] + word[-1]\n        return word[::-1]\n    \n    # Check if the word should be uppercase\n    if len(word) == 2 or (len(word) > 2 and word[-1] == ','):\n        return word.upper()\n    \n    # If no transformation is needed, return the word as is\n    return word\n\ndef transform_sentence(sentence):\n    words = sentence.split()\n    transformed_words = [transform_word(word) for word in words]\n    return ' '.join(transformed_words)\n\n# Read input from standard input\nsentence = input()\n\n# Transform the sentence and print the result to standard output\nprint(transform_sentence(sentence))\n```\n\nThis code defines a function `transform_word` that applies the appropriate transformation to a single word based on the rules. The `transform_sentence` function splits the input sentence into words, transforms each word, and then joins them back into a sentence. The transformed sentence is then printed to standard output."], "prompt_tokens": [489], "completion_tokens": [840], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": false, "language": "Python3", "task_id": 4214}

Regular expressions are a powerful tool for matching patterns within text. In Python, the `re` module provides a set of functions that allows us to search, match, and replace text using regular expressions.\n\n## Tutorial:\nRegular expressions are sequences of characters that define a search pattern. They can be used for string searching and manipulation. In Python, the `re` module provides the following key functions that we will use to solve the problem:\n\n- `re.sub(pattern, repl, string, count=0, flags=0)`: This function returns a new string where occurrences of the `pattern` in the original `string` are replaced by `repl`. The `count` parameter can limit the number of replacements, and `flags` can modify the behavior of the pattern matching.\n\n- `re.IGNORECASE` or `re.I`: This is a flag that can be passed to the `re.sub` function to make the pattern matching case-insensitive.\n\nWhen using `re.sub`, we can use capturing groups `()` and backreferences `\\1`, `\\2`, etc., to refer to the captured groups in the replacement string. This is useful when we want to preserve the case of the matched text.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **URL Parser**: Write a function that takes a URL string and replaces the \"http\" or \"https\" scheme with \"ftp\". This problem can be solved using `re.sub` with a simple pattern that matches \"http\" or \"https\" and replaces it with \"ftp\".\n\n2. **Email Obfuscator**: Given an email address, write a function that replaces the \"@\" symbol with \" [at] \" and \".\" with \" [dot] \" to obfuscate the email. This can be done using `re.sub` with patterns that match \"@\" and \".\".\n\n3. **Phone Number Formatter**: Write a function that takes a string containing a 10-digit phone number and formats it in the pattern \"(xxx) xxx-xxxx\". This requires using `re.sub` with a pattern that captures the digits and a replacement string that arranges the captured groups in the desired format.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\nWe will define a function `gymSlang` that takes a string as input and uses `re.sub` to replace the specified words with their slang equivalents. We will use capturing groups to preserve the case of the first letter of each word that needs to be replaced.\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef gymSlang(text):\n    # Define a list of tuples with the pattern and replacement pairs\n    replacements = [\n        (r'\\b(probably)\\b', 'prolly'),\n        (r'\\b(i am)\\b', \"i'm\"),\n        (r'\\b(instagram)\\b', 'insta'),\n        (r'\\b(do not)\\b', \"don't\"),\n        (r'\\b(going to)\\b', 'gonna'),\n        (r'\\b(combination)\\b', 'combo')\n    ]\n    \n    # Perform the replacements\n    for pattern, slang in replacements:\n        # Use a lambda function to preserve the case of the first letter\n        text = re.sub(pattern, lambda m: slang.capitalize() if m.group(0)[0].isupper() else slang, text, flags=re.I)\n    \n    return text\n\n# Take input from the user\ninput_text = input()\n# Call the function and print the output\nprint(gymSlang(input_text))\n```\n\nThis code will read a string from standard input, process it with the `gymSlang` function, and print the result to standard output. The regular expressions are designed to match whole words only (using `\\b` for word boundaries) and are case-insensitive due to the `re.I` flag. The lambda function in the `re.sub` call checks if the first letter of the matched word is uppercase and, if so, capitalizes the slang replacement."], "prompt_tokens": [730], "completion_tokens": [827], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": true, "language": "Python3", "task_id": 3884}

The algorithm involves the following steps:\n1. Split the input string into two parts: the first half and the second half.\n2. Convert each half into a list of integers.\n3. Sum the integers in each list.\n4. Compare the sums to determine if the ticket is lucky.\n\n## Tutorial:\nTo solve problems like this, you need to be familiar with basic string operations and arithmetic operations in Python. Here's a brief tutorial on these concepts:\n\n### String Slicing:\nIn Python, strings are arrays of bytes representing Unicode characters. You can use slicing to obtain a substring. Slicing uses the syntax `string[start:end]` to get the substring starting from index `start` to `end - 1`.\n\n### List Comprehension:\nList comprehension is a concise way to create lists in Python. It consists of brackets containing an expression followed by a `for` clause, then zero or more `for` or `if` clauses. For example, `[int(digit) for digit in string]` converts each character in a string to an integer and creates a list of these integers.\n\n### Sum Function:\nThe `sum()` function in Python takes an iterable (like a list) and returns the sum of its items.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Palindrome Number**: Check if an integer is a palindrome. A palindrome is a number that reads the same backward as forward. The solution involves converting the number to a string, then comparing the string with its reverse.\n\n2. **Armstrong Number**: Determine if a number is an Armstrong number. An Armstrong number is a number that is the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits. The solution involves splitting the number into digits, raising each to the power of the number of digits, and checking if the sum equals the original number.\n\n3. **Sum of Digits**: Given a non-negative integer, calculate the sum of its digits. You would convert the integer to a string, split it into digits, convert each digit back to an integer, and sum them.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\nThe solution involves taking the input string, slicing it into two halves, converting each half into a list of integers, summing each list, and then comparing the sums to determine if the ticket is lucky.\n\n```python\ndef is_lucky_ticket(ticket):\n    # Split the ticket into two halves\n    first_half = ticket[:3]\n    second_half = ticket[3:]\n    \n    # Convert each half into a list of integers and sum them\n    sum_first_half = sum([int(digit) for digit in first_half])\n    sum_second_half = sum([int(digit) for digit in second_half])\n    \n    # Compare the sums to determine if the ticket is lucky\n    return sum_first_half == sum_second_half\n\n# Take input from the user\nticket_number = input().strip()\n\n# Call the function and print the result\nprint(is_lucky_ticket(ticket_number))\n```\n\nWhen you run this code, it will wait for an input.

Bitwise operations are fundamental in computer science and are used for a variety of purposes, including cryptography, compression, and error detection.\n\n## Tutorial:\nBitwise operations manipulate individual bits within an integer. Here's a brief overview of the operations used in this problem:\n\n- **OR** (`|`): Sets each bit to 1 if one of the two bits is 1. For example, `1010 | 1100` results in `1110`.\n- **AND** (`&`): Sets each bit to 1 if both bits are 1. For example, `1010 & 1100` results in `1000`.\n- **NOT** (`~`): Inverts all the bits. For example, `~1010` results in `0101` (in a 4-bit system; in Python, it considers the number of bits based on the integer size).\n- **XOR** (`^`): Sets each bit to 1 if only one of the two bits is 1. For example, `1010 ^ 1100` results in `0110`.\n- **Shift Left** (`<<`): Shifts all bits to the left by a certain number of positions, filling in with zeros. For example, `1010 << 2` results in `101000`.\n\nWhen implementing a hash function, the goal is to take an input (like a string) and produce a fixed-size string of bytes (the hash). A good hash function should have the following properties:\n\n- It should be fast to compute.\n- It should minimize collisions (different inputs producing the same hash).\n- It should evenly distribute hash values.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Implementing a simple checksum**: A problem where you need to calculate a checksum for data transmission using bitwise operations.\n2. **Creating a Bloom filter**: A Bloom filter uses multiple hash functions to test whether an element is in a set. It's an example of using bitwise operations for probabilistic data structures.\n3. **Encrypting data with XOR**: A simple encryption technique where data is encrypted by performing an XOR operation with a key.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\nThe solution involves calculating the hash value of a string using the provided algorithm. We will iterate over the characters of the string to calculate the sums `a` and `b`, then apply the bitwise operations to obtain the final hash value `d`.\n\nHere's the Python3 code:\n\n```python\ndef string_hash(s):\n    a = sum(ord(char) for char in s)\n    b = sum(ord(s[i+1]) - ord(s[i]) for i in range(len(s) - 1))\n    c = (a | b) & (~a << 2)\n    d = c ^ (32 * (s.count(' ') + 1))\n    return d\n\n# Main execution\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    input_string = input()\n    result = string_hash(input_string)\n    print(result)\n```\n\nThis function reads a string from standard input, computes its hash, and prints the result.\n\n### Example why this hashing algorithm is bad:\nThis hashing algorithm is not ideal for several reasons:\n\n1. **Collision Prone**: It's likely to produce the same hash for different inputs, especially if the inputs are similar.\n2. **Not Uniformly Distributed**: The hash values may not be evenly distributed across the range of possible hash values.\n3. **Predictable**: Given the simplicity of the algorithm, it's easy to predict the hash value for a given input, which is not desirable for security purposes.\n4. **Dependence on Spaces**: The hash value disproportionately depends on the number of spaces in the input, which is not a characteristic of a good hash function.\n\nFor example, two different strings that start with the same character and have the same number of spaces will have the same hash value regardless of the rest of the string content.

{"name": "4391", "description": "## The Story\nGreen Lantern's long hours of study and practice with his ring have really paid off -- his skills, focus, and control have improved so much that now he can even use his ring to update and redesign his web site. Earlier today he was focusing his will and a beam from his ring upon the Justice League web server, while intensely brainstorming and visualizing in minute detail different looks and ideas for his web site, and when he finished and reloaded his home page, he was absolutely thrilled to see that among other things it now displayed\n\n~~~~\nIn brightest day, in blackest night,\nThere's nothing cooler than my site!\n~~~~\n\nin his favorite font in very large blinking green letters.\n\nThe problem is, Green Lantern's ring has no power over anything yellow, so if he's experimenting with his web site and accidentally changes some text or background color to yellow, he will no longer be able to make any changes to those parts of the content or presentation (because he doesn't actually know any HTML, CSS, programming languages, frameworks, etc.) until he gets a more knowledgable friend to edit the code for him.\n\n## Your Mission\nYou can help Green Lantern by writing a function that will replace any color property values that are too yellow with shades of green or blue-green. Presumably at a later time the two of you will be doing some testing to find out at exactly which RGB values yellow stops being yellow and starts being off-white, orange, brown, etc. as far as his ring is concerned, but here's the plan to get version 1.0 up and running as soon as possible:\n\nYour function will receive either an HTML color name or a six-digit hex color code. (You're not going to bother with other types of color codes just now because you don't think they will come up.) If the color is too yellow, your function needs to return a green or blue-green shade instead, but if it is not too yellow, it needs to return the original color name or hex color code unchanged.\n\n### HTML Color Names\n(If don't know what HTML color names are, take a look at this HTML colors names reference.)\n\nFor HMTL color names, you are going to start out trying a pretty strict definition of yellow, replacing any of the following colors as specified:\n\n~~~~\nGold => ForestGreen\nKhaki => LimeGreen\nLemonChiffon => PaleGreen\nLightGoldenRodYellow => SpringGreen\nLightYellow => MintCream\nPaleGoldenRod => LightGreen\nYellow => Lime\n~~~~\n\nHTML color names are case-insensitive, so your function will need to be able to identify the above yellow shades regardless of the cases used, but should output the green shades as capitalized above.\n\nSome examples:\n```\n\"lemonchiffon\"    \"PaleGreen\"\n\"GOLD\"            \"ForestGreen\"\n\"pAlEgOlDeNrOd\"   \"LightGreen\"\n\"BlueViolet\"      \"BlueViolet\"\n```\n\n### Hex Color Codes\n(If you don't know what six-digit hex color codes are, take a look at this Wikipedia description. Basically the six digits are made up of three two-digit numbers in base 16, known as hexidecimal or hex, from 00 to FF (equivalent to 255 in base 10, also known as decimal), with the first two-digit number specifying the color's red value, the second the green value, and the third blue.)\n\nWith six-digit color hex codes, you are going to start out going really overboard, interpreting as \"yellow\" any hex code where the red (R) value and the green (G) value are each greater than the blue (B) value. When you find one of these \"yellow\" hex codes, your function will take the three hex values and rearrange them that the largest goes to G, the middle goes to B, and the smallest to R. \n\nFor example, with the six-digit hex color code `#FFD700`, which has an R value of hex FF (decimal 255), a G value of hex D7 (decimal 215), and a B value of hex 00 (decimal 0), as the R and G values are each larger than the B value, you would return it as `#00FFD7` -- the FF reassigned to G, the D7 to B, and the 00 to R. \n\nHex color codes are also case-insensitive, but your function should output them in the same case they were received in, just for consistency with whatever style is being used.\n\nSome examples:\n```\n\"#000000\"   \"#000000\"\n\"#b8860b\"   \"#0bb886\"\n\"#8FBC8F\"   \"#8FBC8F\"\n\"#C71585\"   \"#C71585\"\n```", "difficulty": "introductory", "id": 4391, "sample_io": [{"input": "lemonchiffon", "output": ["PaleGreen"]}, {"input": "GOLD", "output": ["ForestGreen"]}], "test_list": [{"input": "lemonchiffon", "output": ["PaleGreen"]}, {"input": "GOLD", "output": ["ForestGreen"]}, {"input": "pAlEgOlDeNrOd", "output": ["LightGreen"]}, {"input": "BlueViolet", "output": ["BlueViolet"]}, {"input": "#000000", "output": ["#000000"]}, {"input": "#b8860b", "output": ["#0bb886"]}, {"input": "#8FBC8F", "output": ["#8FBC8F"]}, {"input": "#C71585", "output": ["#C71585"]}], "starter_code": "\ndef yellow_be_gone(s):\n\t", "source_codes": ["\ndef replace_yellow(color):\n    # Dictionary for HTML color names replacement\n    html_colors = {\n        'gold': 'ForestGreen',\n        'khaki': 'LimeGreen',\n        'lemonchiffon': 'PaleGreen',\n        'lightgoldenrodyellow': 'SpringGreen',\n        'lightyellow': 'MintCream',\n        'palegoldenrod': 'LightGreen',\n        'yellow': 'Lime'\n    }\n    \n    # Check if the input is an HTML color name\n    if color.lower() in html_colors:\n        return html_colors[color.lower()]\n    \n    # Check if the input is a hex color code\n    if color.startswith('#') and len(color) == 7:\n        r, g, b = int(color[1:3], 16), int(color[3:5], 16), int(color[5:], 16)\n        if r > b and g > b:\n            # Rearrange the RGB values\n            new_color = (g, b, r)\n            # Format the new color in hex, preserving the case of the input\n            new_color_hex = '#' + ''.join(format(value, '02X' if color.isupper() else '02x') for value in new_color)\n            return new_color_hex\n        else:\n            return color\n    \n    # If the color is neither, return it unchanged\n    return color\n\n# Read input from standard input\ninput_color = input().strip()\n# Call the function and print the result to standard output\nprint(replace_yellow(input_color))\n\n\n"], "responses": ["## Algorithms:\nThe core concepts used to solve this problem are string manipulation, conditional logic, and hexadecimal conversion.

For the polydivisible number problem, we start from the given number and incrementally check each subsequent number to see if it satisfies the polydivisibility condition.\n\nTo check if a number is polydivisible, we need to verify that for a number with `n` digits, each prefix of the number of length `i` (where `1 <= i <= n`) is divisible by `i`. For example, the number `1232` is polydivisible because `1` is divisible by `1`, `12` is divisible by `2`, `123` is divisible by `3`, and `1232` is divisible by `4`.\n\nThe brute force approach is not the most efficient, but given that polydivisible numbers are rare, it is a viable solution for this problem.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Next Prime Number**: Given a number, find the next prime number greater than the input number. The solution involves checking each number greater than the input to see if it is prime, which can be done by verifying that it has no divisors other than 1 and itself.\n\n2. **Happy Number**: A happy number is a number which eventually reaches 1 when replaced by the sum of the square of each digit.

We need to check both possibilities because we don't know which removal will lead to a strictly increasing sequence.\n\nTo check if the sequence is strictly increasing after a potential removal, we can create a helper function that takes the sequence and the index of the element to be \"virtually\" removed and returns whether the remaining sequence is strictly increasing.\n\nThe key is to ensure that we only need to remove at most one element.

In Python, you can round numbers using the built-in `round()` function, but for this problem, we need to round to the nearest tens, which requires a custom approach. You can achieve this by dividing the number by 10, rounding it, and then multiplying it back by 10.\n\n### Integer Division and Modulo Operations:\nInteger division (`//`) divides two numbers and rounds down to the nearest integer.

These operations are useful for manipulating digits within a number, such as dropping the last digit or checking if a number is even or odd.\n\n### Conditional Statements:\nConditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`) are used to execute different blocks of code based on certain conditions. They are fundamental in programming and are used to implement logic that requires decision-making.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Rounding Grades**: Students receive grades that need to be rounded according to specific rules.

The algorithm involves checking the case of each character and then converting it to the opposite case.\n\n## Tutorial:\nString manipulation is a common task in programming, and changing the case of characters is a basic operation. In Python, strings are immutable, which means they cannot be changed after they are created. Therefore, to create a new string with alternating cases, you need to build a new string character by character.\n\nTo change the case of a character in Python, you can use the `upper()` and `lower()` methods. These methods are called on a string (or character) and return a new string with all characters converted to uppercase or lowercase, respectively.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide to solving the problem:\n1. Initialize an empty string that will hold the result.\n2. Iterate over each character in the input string.\n3. For each character, check if it is uppercase or lowercase.\n4. If it is uppercase, convert it to lowercase and append it to the result string.\n5. If it is lowercase, convert it to uppercase and append it to the result string.\n6. If it is neither (e.g., a digit or special character), append it as is to the result string.\n7. Return the result string.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Reverse String**: Given a string, write a function to reverse it. You can solve this by iterating over the string in reverse order and appending each character to a new string.\n\n2. **Palindrome Checker**: Write a function to check if a given string is a palindrome (reads the same backward as forward). This involves comparing characters from the beginning and end of the string, moving towards the center.\n\n3. **Caesar Cipher**: Implement a Caesar cipher, where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down the alphabet. This requires iterating over the string and shifting the ASCII value of each character.\n\nFor each of these problems, the solution would involve iterating over the string and applying some condition or transformation to each character.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\nThe solution involves iterating over each character in the input string and using the `isupper()` and `islower()` methods to check the case of the character. If the character is uppercase, we convert it to lowercase using `lower()`, and if it is lowercase, we convert it to uppercase using `upper()`. If the character is neither (like a digit or punctuation), we simply append it to the result string without changing its case.\n\nHere's the Python3 code:\n\n```python\ndef to_alternating_case(s):\n    result = \"\"\n    for char in s:\n        if char.isupper():\n            result += char.lower()\n        elif char.islower():\n            result += char.upper()\n        else:\n            result += char\n    return result\n\n# Taking input from standard input and printing the result to standard output\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    input_string = input()\n    output_string = to_alternating_case(input_string)\n    print(output_string)\n```\n\nWhen you run this code, it will wait for an input string, apply the `to_alternating_case` function, and then print the resulting string with alternating cases."], "prompt_tokens": [528], "completion_tokens": [679], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": true, "language": "Python3", "task_id": 2798}

The key observation is that the digit sum of a number is maximized when the number has more digits, and each digit is as large as possible (up to 9). Therefore, we want to split `n` into two numbers `a` and `b` such that one of them has as many 9s as possible.\n\n## Tutorial:\nTo maximize the digit sum of two numbers whose sum is `n`, we should try to make one of the numbers a multiple of 9, since 9 is the largest single-digit number and contributes the most to the digit sum. The reason for this is that the digit sum of a number that is a multiple of 9 is simply 9 times the number of digits in that multiple of 9 (except for the number 0, which has a digit sum of 0).\n\nFor example, if `n` is 29, we can split it into 20 and 9. The digit sum of 20 is 2, and the digit sum of 9 is 9, giving us a total of 11, which is the maximum possible.\n\nTo implement this, we can iterate from 0 to `n` and check the digit sum of both `i` and `n - i`. However, this would be inefficient for large values of `n`. Instead, we can directly calculate the largest multiple of 9 that is less than or equal to `n` and use that as one of our numbers.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Maximize Number of 9s**: Given an integer `n`, find the largest integer less than or equal to `n` that contains only the digit 9. The solution is to find the largest multiple of 9 that is less than or equal to `n` and then construct the number by repeating the digit 9 the appropriate number of times.\n\n2. **Best Sum Partition**: Given an integer `n`, partition it into two non-negative integers such that their sum is equal to `n` and the product of their digit sums is maximized. This problem is similar to the original problem but requires maximizing the product instead of the sum of digit sums.\n\n3. **Largest Digit Sum in a Range**: Given two integers `a` and `b`, find the number in the range `[a, b]` that has the largest digit sum. This problem can be solved by iterating through the range and calculating the digit sum for each number, keeping track of the maximum.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\nTo solve the problem, we will find the largest multiple of 9 that is less than or equal to `n`. This will be one of our numbers, `a`. The other number, `b`, will be `n - a`. We then calculate the digit sums of `a` and `b` and return their sum.\n\n```python\ndef digit_sum(x):\n    return sum(int(digit) for digit in str(x))\n\ndef solve(n):\n    # Find the largest multiple of 9 less than or equal to n\n    a = n - (n % 9)\n    b = n - a\n    # Calculate and return the sum of digit sums of a and b\n    return digit_sum(a) + digit_sum(b)\n\n# Read input from standard input, call the function, and print the output\nn = int(input())\nprint(solve(n))\n```\n\nThis code defines a helper function `digit_sum` to calculate the sum of digits of a number. The `solve` function calculates `a` as the largest multiple of 9 less than or equal to `n` and `b` as the difference between `n` and `a`.

The merge sort algorithm is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that sorts a list by dividing it into two halves, sorting each half, and then merging the sorted halves. While merging, we can count the inversions.\n\n## Tutorial:\nThe merge sort algorithm works by recursively splitting the list into two halves until each sublist contains a single element. Then, it merges these sublists to produce new sorted sublists until the entire list is merged into a single sorted list.\n\nTo count inversions, we modify the merge step of the merge sort algorithm. When merging two sorted sublists, if an element in the right sublist is smaller than an element in the left sublist, then there are as many inversions as there are remaining elements in the left sublist, because the element in the right sublist must be placed before all of these elements in the sorted order.\n\nHere's a step-by-step process to count inversions during the merge step:\n1. Start with two pointers, one for each sublist.\n2. Compare the elements at the pointers.\n3. If the element in the left sublist is smaller or equal, move it to the merged list and advance the pointer.\n4. If the element in the right sublist is smaller, move it to the merged list, advance the pointer, and add the number of remaining elements in the left sublist to the inversion count.\n5. Repeat steps 2-4 until all elements are merged.\n6. Return the total count of inversions.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Counting Inversions using BIT (Binary Indexed Tree)**: Given an array of integers, count the number of inversions using a Binary Indexed Tree. The solution involves updating the BIT with the frequency of each number and querying the sum of frequencies of numbers greater than the current number.\n\n2. **Minimum Swaps to Sort**: Given an array of integers, find the minimum number of swaps required to sort the array. This problem can be solved by first computing the number of inversions and then using the fact that each swap reduces the number of inversions by exactly one.\n\n3. **Find the Smaller Elements**: Given an array of integers, for each element, find the number of smaller elements that appear after it in the array. This problem can be solved by modifying the merge sort algorithm to count the number of smaller elements during the merge step.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\nWe will implement a function `count_inversion` that uses a helper function `merge_count` to count inversions while performing the merge step of the merge sort algorithm. The `count_inversion` function will recursively split the sequence and use `merge_count` to merge and count inversions.\n\n```python\ndef merge_count(left, right):\n    result = []\n    i, j = 0, 0\n    inv_count = 0\n    while i < len(left) and j < len(right):\n        if left[i] <= right[j]:\n            result.append(left[i])\n            i += 1\n        else:\n            result.append(right[j])\n            j += 1\n            inv_count += len(left) - i\n    result += left[i:]\n    result += right[j:]\n    return result, inv_count\n\ndef count_inversion(sequence):\n    if len(sequence) <= 1:\n        return sequence, 0\n    mid = len(sequence) // 2\n    left, inv_left = count_inversion(sequence[:mid])\n    right, inv_right = count_inversion(sequence[mid:])\n    merged, inv_count = merge_count(left, right)\n    return merged, inv_left + inv_right + inv_count\n\n# Read input from standard input\nsequence = list(map(int, input().strip().split(',')))\n\n# Call the function and print the result to standard output\n_, inversions = count_inversion(sequence)\nprint(inversions)\n```\n\nTo use the code above, you would input the sequence of numbers separated by commas (e.g., `1,2,5,3,4,7,6`) and the code will output the number of inversions in the sequence."], "prompt_tokens": [492], "completion_tokens": [862], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": false, "language": "Python3", "task_id": 3562}

Primality Test: To check if a number is prime.\n2. Exponentiation: To calculate 2^n.\n\n## Tutorial:\n### Primality Test:\nA primality test is an algorithm that determines whether a given number is prime or not. There are several methods to test for primality, ranging from naive division by all integers up to the square root of the number, to more sophisticated algorithms like the Miller-Rabin primality test or the AKS primality test.\n\nFor small numbers, the simplest method is to check divisibility by all integers from 2 up to the square root of the number. If the number is not divisible by any of these, it is prime.\n\n### Exponentiation:\nExponentiation is the mathematical operation of raising one number (the base) to the power of another number (the exponent). In Python, this can be done using the `**` operator or the `pow` function. For example, `2 ** n` or `pow(2, n)` will calculate 2 raised to the power of n.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Prime Checking**: Given an integer, determine if it is a prime number.\n   - Solution: Use a primality test algorithm to check if the number is divisible by any number from 2 to its square root.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def is_prime(num):\n         if num <= 1:\n             return False\n         for i in range(2, int(num**0.5) + 1):\n             if num % i == 0:\n                 return False\n         return True\n     ```\n\n2. **Power of Two**: Given an integer, determine if it is a power of two.\n   - Solution: A number is a power of two if it is greater than zero and the bitwise AND of the number and its predecessor is zero.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def is_power_of_two(n):\n         return n > 0 and (n & (n - 1)) == 0\n     ```\n\n3. **Finding the Next Prime**: Given an integer, find the next prime number.\n   - Solution: Increment the given number and use a primality test on each subsequent number until a prime is found.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def next_prime(num):\n         def is_prime(n):\n             if n <= 1:\n                 return False\n             for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):\n                 if n % i == 0:\n                     return False\n             return True\n         \n         prime = num + 1\n         while not is_prime(prime):\n             prime += 1\n         return prime\n     ```\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\nTo determine if `n` will produce a Mersenne prime, we first calculate `Mn = 2^n - 1`. Then we check if `Mn` is a prime number using a primality test. If it is prime, we return `True`; otherwise, we return `False`.\n\nPython3 code:\n```python\ndef is_prime(num):\n    if num <= 1:\n        return False\n    for i in range(2, int(num**0.5) + 1):\n        if num % i == 0:\n            return False\n    return True\n\ndef is_mersenne_prime(n):\n    mersenne_number = 2**n - 1\n    return is_prime(mersenne_number)\n\n# Taking input and printing the output\nn = int(input())\nprint(is_mersenne_prime(n))\n```\n\nThis code defines a function `is_prime` to check for primality and a function `is_mersenne_prime` to check if the number `n` produces a Mersenne prime.

The idea is to count the number of ways to form numbers with exactly `k` non-zero digits up to each digit of `n`. This is a variation of the digit DP (Dynamic Programming) technique.\n\n## Tutorial:\nDigit DP is a technique used to count the number of integers within a range that satisfy certain digit-related conditions. The main idea is to iterate over the digits of the number from the most significant digit to the least significant one, and at each step, calculate the number of valid numbers that can be formed with the remaining digits.\n\nTo apply digit DP, we usually define a recursive function with parameters that represent the current position in the number, the state of the condition we are tracking (in this case, the number of non-zero digits), and whether we are currently at the limit of the given number `n`. The function returns the count of valid numbers from the current position to the end.\n\nThe state of the DP can be cached (memoized) to avoid recomputing the same subproblems, which significantly improves the efficiency of the algorithm.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Counting Numbers with Fixed Sum of Digits**: Given a number `n` and a sum `s`, count how many numbers between 1 and `n` have digits that sum up to `s`.\n2. **Counting Numbers with No Consecutive Ones**: Given a number `n`, count how many numbers between 1 and `n` do not contain consecutive ones in their binary representation.\n3. **Counting Numbers with Certain Digits Forbidden**: Given a number `n` and a list of digits that are not allowed, count how many numbers between 1 and `n` do not contain any of the forbidden digits.\n\nFor each of these problems, the solution involves setting up a digit DP framework where the state captures the relevant information (sum of digits, presence of consecutive ones, or use of forbidden digits) and iterating over the digits of `n` to compute the count.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\nWe will use digit DP to solve this problem. We will define a recursive function that takes parameters for the current position, the count of non-zero digits so far, and whether we are at the limit of `n`.

The first digit is cleanly divisible by `1`, the first two digits are cleanly divisible by `2`, the first three by `3` and so on.\n\nThe interesting thing about polydivisiblity is that it relates to the underlying number, but not the base it is written in, so if aliens came to Earth and used base `23` (`11` fingers on one hand and `12` on the other), no matter what squiggles they use to write numbers, they would find the same numbers polydivisible!\n\n### Polydivisibilty Example:\n\nLet's do a worked example to clear up any questions ...\n\nStarting wih the number `1,232` in base `10` then:\n\n```\n 1232\n 1    /1 = 1    Yay!\n 12   /2 = 6    Yay!\n 123  /3 = 41   Yay!\n 1232 /4 = 308  Yay!\n```\n\nThus `1,232` is a polydivisible number in base `4` and above.\n\nHowever starting wih the number `123,220` and using base `10` then:\n\n```\n 123220\n 1      /1 = 1            Yay!\n 12     /2 = 6            Yay!\n 123    /3 = 41           Yay!\n 1232   /4 = 308          Yay!\n 12322  /5 = 2464.4       Oh no, that's not a round number!\n 123220 /6 = 220536.333r  Oh no, that's not a round number!\n```\n\nThus `123,220` is not a polydivisible base 10 number, but what about in another base?\n\nAgain starting wih the number `123,220` and using base `6` then:\n\n```\n base 6   base 10\n 1      = 1       -> 1     /1 = 1     Yay!\n 12     = 8       -> 8     /2 = 4     Yay!\n 123    = 51      -> 51    /3 = 17    Yay!\n 1232   = 308     -> 308   /4 = 77    Yay!\n 12322  = 1850    -> 1850  /5 = 370   Yay!\n 123220 = 11100   -> 11100 /6 = 1850  Yay!\n```\n\nThus `123,220` is a polydivisible base `6` number (and a polydivisible base `10` number when converted to `11100` in base `10`).\n\n### Kata\n\nIn this kata you must implement two methods: `is_polydivisible(n, b)` and `get_polydivisible(n, b)`.\n\nThe first `is_polydivisible(n, b)` will return `True` if `n` is polydivisible in base `b` or `False` if not.\n\nThe second `get_polydivisible(n, b)` will return the `n`th polydivisible number using base `b`, the first polydivisible number is of course always `0`.\n\nYou can assume that all inputs are valid.\n\n```if:haskell\nAll necessary arithmetic can be done in `Int` range.\n```\n\n### Kata Examples:\n\n```python\n    is_polydivisible(\"1232\", 10)   # => True\n    is_polydivisible(\"123220\", 10) # => False\n    is_polydivisible(\"123220\", 6)  # => True\n    get_polydivisible(22, 10)      # => \"32\"\n    get_polydivisible(22, 16)      # => \"1A\"\n    get_polydivisible(42, 16)      # => \"42\"\n```\n\n#### A Note on Bases\n\nThe maximum base used is base `62`, and uses characters in the following order `[0-9][A-Z][a-z]` to denote its digits, base `n` will use the first `n` characters of this sequence.\n```if-not:haskell\nA constant CHARS has been declared with this sequence for you.\n```", "difficulty": "interview", "id": 1627, "sample_io": [{"input": "123\n10", "output": [true]}, {"input": "1234\n10", "output": [false]}], "test_list": [{"input": "123\n10", "output": [true]}, {"input": "1234\n10", "output": [false]}, {"input": "12345\n10", "output": [false]}, {"input": "12365\n10", "output": [true]}, {"input": "123220\n10", "output": [false]}, {"input": "50041\n6", "output": [true]}, {"input": "140410\n6", "output": [true]}, {"input": "203230\n6", "output": [true]}, {"input": "30043052\n6", "output": [true]}], "starter_code": "\ndef is_polydivisible(s, b):\n\t", "source_codes": ["\nCHARS = \"0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\"\n\ndef is_polydivisible(s, b):\n    num = 0\n    for i in range(len(s)):\n        num = num * b + CHARS.index(s[i])\n        if num % (i + 1) != 0:\n            return False\n    return True\n\ndef get_polydivisible(n, b):\n    if n == 1:\n        return \"0\"\n    count = 1  # Start with 0 as the first polydivisible number\n    num = 1\n    while count < n:\n        num += 1\n        if is_polydivisible(base_convert(num, b), b):\n            count += 1\n    return base_convert(num, b)\n\ndef base_convert(num, base):\n    if num == 0:\n        return CHARS[0]\n    digits = \"\"\n    while num:\n        digits = CHARS[num % base] + digits\n        num //= base\n    return digits\n\n# Read input and call the functions\ninput_str = input().strip()\nbase = int(input().strip())\nif input_str.isdigit() and 1 <= base <= 62:\n    print(is_polydivisible(input_str, base))\nelse:\n    n = int(input_str)\n    print(get_polydivisible(n, base))\n\n\n"], "responses": ["## Algorithms:\nThe core concepts used to solve the problem of polydivisibility are:\n1. Base conversion: Understanding how to convert numbers between different bases.\n2. Modular arithmetic: Using the modulus operator to check for divisibility.\n3. Iteration: Iterating through digits of a number to apply divisibility checks.\n\n## Tutorial:\n### Base Conversion:\nBase conversion is the process of changing the base of a number. For example, converting a number from base 10 to base 2. To convert a number to a different base, you can repeatedly divide the number by the new base and keep track of the remainders. The remainders, read in reverse order, give the number in the new base.\n\n### Modular Arithmetic:\nModular arithmetic involves the modulus operator, which gives the remainder of a division. It is used to check divisibility; a number `n` is divisible by `d` if `n % d == 0`.\n\n### Iteration:\nIteration is the process of looping through data. In this problem, we iterate through the digits of a number, checking the divisibility of the increasingly larger prefixes of the number.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Base Conversion Problem**: Given a number in base 10, convert it to base 2.\n   Solution: Repeatedly divide the number by 2 and keep track of the remainders. The binary number is the sequence of remainders read in reverse order.\n   Python3 code:\n   ```python\n   def convert_to_base2(n):\n       if n == 0:\n           return '0'\n       binary = ''\n       while n > 0:\n           binary = str(n % 2) + binary\n           n = n // 2\n       return binary\n   ```\n\n2. **Divisibility Check**: Given a list of numbers, print those that are divisible by a given divisor.\n   Solution: Iterate through the list and use the modulus operator to check for divisibility.\n   Python3 code:\n   ```python\n   def print_divisible_numbers(numbers, divisor):\n       for number in numbers:\n           if number % divisor == 0:\n               print(number)\n   ```\n\n3. **Finding the nth Prime Number**: Write a function to find the nth prime number.\n   Solution: Use a sieve algorithm or iterative checks for divisibility to find all prime numbers up to the nth prime.\n   Python3 code:\n   ```python\n   def is_prime(num):\n       if num <= 1:\n           return False\n       for i in range(2, int(num**0.5) + 1):\n           if num % i == 0:\n               return False\n       return True\n\n   def find_nth_prime(n):\n       count = 0\n       num = 2\n       while True:\n           if is_prime(num):\n               count += 1\n               if count == n:\n                   return num\n           num += 1\n   ```\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\n- `is_polydivisible(n, b)`: Convert the string `n` to a number in base `b`, then check each prefix of the number for divisibility by its position.\n- `get_polydivisible(n, b)`: Generate polydivisible numbers in base `b` until the nth polydivisible number is found.\n\n```python\nCHARS = \"0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\"\n\ndef is_polydivisible(s, b):\n    num = 0\n    for i in range(len(s)):\n        num = num * b + CHARS.index(s[i])\n        if num % (i + 1) != 0:\n            return False\n    return True\n\ndef get_polydivisible(n, b):\n    if n == 1:\n        return \"0\"\n    count = 1  # Start with 0 as the first polydivisible number\n    num = 1\n    while count < n:\n        num += 1\n        if is_polydivisible(base_convert(num, b), b):\n            count += 1\n    return base_convert(num, b)\n\ndef base_convert(num, base):\n    if num == 0:\n        return CHARS[0]\n    digits = \"\"\n    while num:\n        digits = CHARS[num % base] + digits\n        num //= base\n    return digits\n\n# Read input and call the functions\ninput_str = input().strip()\nbase = int(input().strip())\nif input_str.isdigit() and 1 <= base <= 62:\n    print(is_polydivisible(input_str, base))\nelse:\n    n = int(input_str)\n    print(get_polydivisible(n, base))\n```\n\nThis code defines the `is_polydivisible` and `get_polydivisible` functions and uses a helper function `base_convert` to convert numbers to a given base using the CHARS constant.

If f(n) stands for the number of solutions that belong to n-th class, it means that S(k) = f(1) + f(2) + f(3) + ...\n\nThe reasoning presented above leads us to some kind of a formula for S(k), however not necessarily the most efficient one.

The key insight is that for each divisor `m` of a number `i`, there is a corresponding divisor `i/m`. This allows us to count divisors in pairs, which leads to the realization that we only need to iterate up to the square root of `i` to count all divisors.\n\n## Tutorial:\nTo solve this problem, we need to understand the divisor function `d(n)`, which counts the number of distinct divisors of `n`. A naive approach would be to iterate over all numbers from `1` to `n` and for each number, iterate from `1` to the number itself to count divisors. This approach, however, is not efficient for large values of `n`.\n\nA more efficient approach is to realize that divisors come in pairs. For example, if `6` is a divisor of `12`, then `12/6 = 2` is also a divisor of `12`. This means we only need to iterate up to the square root of the number to find all divisor pairs.\n\nFurthermore, we can optimize the counting of divisors for all numbers up to `n` by considering the problem in terms of counting pairs `(m, n)` such that `m * n <= k`. For each `n`, we can count how many `m` values satisfy this inequality, which is equivalent to counting the number of divisors for each `n`.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Counting Divisors**: Given a number `n`, count the number of divisors of `n`. The solution involves iterating from `1` to `sqrt(n)` and counting the pairs of divisors.\n\n2. **Sum of Divisors**: Given a number `n`, find the sum of all divisors of `n`. This problem extends the counting divisors problem by summing the divisors instead of just counting them.\n\n3. **Highly Composite Numbers**: Find the smallest number with more divisors than any smaller number.

Python provides a rich set of methods to manipulate strings, which can be used to construct the desired output format.\n\n**Sorting**: Sorting is a fundamental operation in many algorithms.

Thank you problem writers.\n\nYou are helping an archaeologist decipher some runes. He knows that this ancient society used a Base 10 system, and that they never start a number with a leading zero. He's figured out most of the digits as well as a few operators, but he needs your help to figure out the rest.\n\nThe professor will give you a simple math expression, of the form\n\n```\n[number][op][number]=[number]\n```\n\nHe has converted all of the runes he knows into digits. The only operators he knows are addition (`+`),subtraction(`-`), and multiplication (`*`), so those are the only ones that will appear. Each number will be in the range from -1000000 to 1000000, and will consist of only the digits 0-9, possibly a leading -, and maybe a few ?s. If there are ?s in an expression, they represent a digit rune that the professor doesn't know (never an operator, and never a leading -). All of the ?s in an expression will represent the same digit (0-9), and it won't be one of the other given digits in the expression. No number will begin with a 0 unless the number itself is  0, therefore 00 would not be a valid number. \n\nGiven an expression, figure out the value of the rune represented by the question mark. If more than one digit works, give the lowest one. If no digit works, well, that's bad news for the professor - it means that he's got some of his runes wrong. output -1 in that case.\n\nComplete the method to solve the expression to find the value of the unknown rune. The method takes a string as a paramater repressenting the expression and will return an int value representing the unknown rune or -1 if no such rune exists.\n\n~~~if:php\n**Most of the time, the professor will be able to figure out most of the runes himself, but sometimes, there may be exactly 1 rune present in the expression that the professor cannot figure out (resulting in all question marks where the digits are in the expression) so be careful ;)**\n~~~", "difficulty": "interview", "id": 1654, "sample_io": [{"input": "123?45*?=?", "output": [0]}, {"input": "?*123?45=?", "output": [0]}], "test_list": [{"input": "123?45*?=?", "output": [0]}, {"input": "?*123?45=?", "output": [0]}, {"input": "??605*-63=-73???5", "output": [1]}, {"input": "123?45+?=123?45", "output": [0]}, {"input": "?8?170-1?6256=7?2?14", "output": [9]}, {"input": "?38???+595???=833444", "output": [2]}, {"input": "123?45-?=123?45", "output": [0]}, {"input": "-7715?5--484?00=-28?9?5", "output": [6]}, {"input": "50685?--1?5630=652?8?", "output": [4]}, {"input": "??+??=??", "output": [-1]}, {"input": "-?56373--9216=-?47157", "output": [8]}], "starter_code": "\ndef solve_runes(runes):\n\t", "source_codes": ["\ndef solve_runes(expression):\n    for digit in range(10):\n        if str(digit) not in expression:  # Check if the digit is not already in the expression\n            # Replace '?' with the current digit and split the expression into parts\n            new_expr = expression.replace('?', str(digit))\n            if '0' not in [x[0] for x in new_expr.split('=')[0].split('*') if x != '']:  # Check for leading zeros\n                try:\n                    # Split the expression into left and right parts\n                    left, right = new_expr.split('=')\n                    # Evaluate both parts and check if they are equal\n                    if eval(left) == eval(right):\n                        return digit\n                except:\n                    pass\n    return -1\n\n# Read the input expression from standard input\nexpression = input().strip()\n# Solve the expression and print the result\nprint(solve_runes(expression))\n\n\n"], "responses": ["## Algorithms:\nTo solve this problem, we will use the following core concepts:\n1.

Expression evaluation: To check if the expression holds true after replacing '?' with a digit.\n\n## Tutorial:\n### String Manipulation:\nString manipulation involves operations like slicing, replacing, and searching within strings. In Python, strings are immutable, so operations like replace return a new string.\n\n### Brute Force Search:\nA brute force search is a straightforward approach to solving a problem by trying all possible solutions until the correct one is found. It is often used when the problem space is small or when there is no more efficient algorithm available.\n\n### Expression Evaluation:\nExpression evaluation is the process of calculating the result of an expression. In Python, the `eval()` function can be used to evaluate a string expression, but it should be used with caution as it can execute arbitrary code.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Sudoku Solver**: Given a partially filled 9x9 grid, fill in the missing numbers such that each row, column, and 3x3 subgrid contains all the digits from 1 to 9. The solution involves using a brute force search to try all possible numbers in the empty cells and backtracking when a conflict is found.\n\n2. **N-Queens**: Place N queens on an N\u00d7N chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other. The solution involves placing a queen in each row and using a brute force search to try all columns while checking for conflicts with existing queens.\n\n3. **Permutations of a String**: Given a string, print all permutations of the characters in the string. The solution involves using a brute force search to swap characters and generate all possible permutations.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n### Explanation of the solution:\nWe will iterate over all possible digits (0-9) and replace '?' with each digit in the expression. We will then evaluate the expression to see if it is valid. If the expression is valid with the substituted digit, we return that digit.

Handle the scale of numbers (thousand, million) by multiplying the current total by the scale factor.\n4. Handle the compound numbers (twenty-one, one hundred and twenty-four) by adding or multiplying as appropriate.\n5. Accumulate the result as you parse the string.\n\n## Tutorial:\nTo convert a number in word form to an integer, you need to understand the structure of number words in English. Numbers are composed of units (one, two, three, etc.), tens (twenty, thirty, etc.), hundreds, and powers of a thousand (thousand, million). The word \"and\" is sometimes used as a separator but does not affect the numerical value.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide to the algorithm:\n\n1. Create a dictionary that maps number words to their values. This includes units (one to nine), teens (eleven to nineteen), tens (twenty to ninety), and the larger scales (hundred, thousand, and million).\n\n2. Split the input string into words. This can be done using the `split()` method in Python.\n\n3. Initialize a variable to hold the current total and another to hold the current group value (since numbers are often grouped by hundreds before being multiplied by a thousand or a million).\n\n4. Iterate over the words. If the word corresponds to a unit or a teen, add it to the current group value. If it's a ten, multiply the last unit by the ten's value (if present) and add it to the group value. If the word is \"hundred\", multiply the current group value by 100. If the word is \"thousand\" or \"million\", add the current group value to the total, then multiply the total by the scale factor.\n\n5. After processing all words, add the last group value to the total.\n\n6. Return the total as the final integer value.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Parsing Roman Numerals**: Convert a Roman numeral to an integer. The solution involves mapping Roman numeral characters to their values and parsing the string from left to right, adding or subtracting values as dictated by the rules of Roman numerals.\n\n2. **Parsing Time in Words**: Given a time in words, convert it to a digital format (e.g., \"five o'clock\" to \"5:00\"). This involves mapping words to numbers and handling special cases like \"quarter past\" or \"half past\".\n\n3. **Currency in Words to Numbers**: Given a currency amount in words (e.g., \"twenty dollars and fifteen cents\"), convert it to a numerical format (e.g., 20.15). This involves parsing the string for the dollar and cent amounts and converting each part to a numerical value.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n```python\ndef word_to_num(word):\n    num_words = {\n        \"zero\": 0, \"one\": 1, \"two\": 2, \"three\": 3, \"four\": 4, \"five\": 5, \"six\": 6, \"seven\": 7, \"eight\": 8, \"nine\": 9,\n        \"ten\": 10, \"eleven\": 11, \"twelve\": 12, \"thirteen\": 13, \"fourteen\": 14, \"fifteen\": 15, \"sixteen\": 16,\n        \"seventeen\": 17, \"eighteen\": 18, \"nineteen\": 19, \"twenty\": 20, \"thirty\": 30, \"forty\": 40, \"fifty\": 50,\n        \"sixty\": 60, \"seventy\": 70, \"eighty\": 80, \"ninety\": 90\n    }\n    scale_words = {\"hundred\": 100, \"thousand\": 1000, \"million\": 1000000}\n    \n    words = word.replace(\" and\", \"\").split()\n    total = 0\n    current_group_value = 0\n    \n    for w in words:\n        if w in num_words:\n            current_group_value += num_words[w]\n        elif w in scale_words:\n            if w == \"hundred\":\n                current_group_value *= scale_words[w]\n            else:\n                current_group_value *= scale_words[w]\n                total += current_group_value\n                current_group_value = 0\n    total += current_group_value\n    return total\n\n# Main code to take input and print the output\ninput_word = input().strip()\nprint(word_to_num(input_word))\n```\n\nThis code defines a function `word_to_num` that takes a string representing a number in words and returns the corresponding integer.

Here's a high-level overview of how we might do this:\n\n1. Start with an initial sequence (which could be empty or start with the number 1).\n2. At each step, consider all possible numbers that can be appended to the current sequence without violating the constraint that the product of all numbers in the sequence must equal `n`.\n3. If the sequence has `k` numbers and the product is `n`, we have found a valid solution.\n4. If the sequence has fewer than `k` numbers, recursively continue the process from step 2.\n5. If at any point the product of the numbers in the sequence exceeds `n`, backtrack and try a different number.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Subset Sum Problem**: Given a set of non-negative integers, and a value sum, determine if there is a subset of the given set with sum equal to given sum. This problem can be solved using backtracking by trying to include or exclude each element and checking if the desired sum can be achieved.\n\n2. **N-Queens Problem**: The problem of placing N chess queens on an N\u00d7N chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other.

Recursion is used to traverse nested arrays (lists in Python) and compare their structure. The algorithm will check if both arrays have the same length and for each element, it will recursively check if the structure is the same in case of nested arrays.\n\n## Tutorial:\nRecursion is a method of solving problems where the solution to a problem depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem. In the context of this problem, recursion allows us to \"drill down\" into nested arrays to compare their structures at each level.\n\nHere's a step-by-step approach to solve the problem using recursion:\n\n1. Check if both arrays have the same length. If not, return `False`.\n2. Iterate over the elements of both arrays simultaneously.\n3. For each pair of elements, check the following:\n   - If both elements are arrays, recursively call the function to compare their structures.\n   - If one element is an array and the other is not, return `False`.\n4. If all elements pass the structure check, return `True`.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Checking for Balanced Parentheses**: Given a string containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid. An input string is valid if:\n   - Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.\n   - Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.\n   The solution involves using a stack to keep track of opening brackets and ensuring they match with the closing ones.\n\n2. **Flatten Nested List Iterator**: Given a nested list of integers, implement an iterator to flatten it. Each element is either an integer or a list whose elements may also be integers or other lists. The solution involves using a stack or recursion to handle the nested structure.\n\n3. **Serialize and Deserialize Binary Tree**: Serialization is converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link. Deserialization is the reverse process. The solution involves using recursion to traverse the tree and encode its structure as a string, and then using recursion again to rebuild the tree from the string.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\nThe solution involves defining a function `same_structure_as` that takes two arrays as arguments. It will use recursion to compare the structure of the two arrays. If the arrays have different lengths or if one is an array and the other is not at any level of nesting, the function will return `False`. Otherwise, it will return `True`.\n\nHere's the Python3 code:\n\n```python\ndef same_structure_as(original, other):\n    # Check if both are lists and have the same length\n    if isinstance(original, list) and isinstance(other, list) and len(original) == len(other):\n        # Recursively check each element\n        for orig_elem, other_elem in zip(original, other):\n            if not same_structure_as(orig_elem, other_elem):\n                return False\n        return True\n    else:\n        # If one is a list and the other is not, return False\n        # If both are not lists, return True (matching structure)\n        return not (isinstance(original, list) or isinstance(other, list))\n\n# Read input from standard input\nimport ast\noriginal = ast.literal_eval(input())\nother = ast.literal_eval(input())\n\n# Call the function and print the result\nprint(same_structure_as(original, other))\n```\n\nThis code uses `ast.literal_eval` to safely evaluate the string input as a Python expression, which is expected to be a list.

However, since the rings start at 0 and move in opposite directions, we need to add one to the LCM to account for the initial alignment.\n\n## Tutorial:\nThe least common multiple (LCM) of two integers is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both numbers. There are several ways to calculate the LCM, but one of the most common methods is to use the greatest common divisor (GCD), also known as the highest common factor (HCF). The LCM of two numbers a and b can be calculated using the formula:\n\n```\nLCM(a, b) = |a * b| / GCD(a, b)\n```\n\nThe GCD of two numbers can be found using the Euclidean algorithm, which is based on the principle that the GCD of two numbers also divides their difference.

Aggregating monomials with the same variable parts.\n4. Sorting the aggregated monomials first by the number of variables and then lexicographically.\n5. Constructing the output string with the simplified expression.\n\n## Tutorial:\n### Parsing and Normalizing Monomials:\nWe need to split the input string into individual monomials. A monomial in this context is a sequence of characters representing a variable (e.g., \"xy\") possibly preceded by a coefficient (e.g., \"3xy\"). We can split the string at '+' and '-' signs, taking care to keep the '-' sign as part of the monomial if it's a subtraction.\n\nOnce we have the monomials, we normalize them by sorting the variable parts lexicographically. This ensures that \"xy\" and \"yx\" are treated as the same monomial.\n\n### Aggregating Monomials:\nWe can use a dictionary to aggregate monomials with the same variable parts. The keys of the dictionary will be the variable parts, and the values will be the sum of coefficients for those variables.\n\n### Sorting Monomials:\nAfter aggregation, we need to sort the monomials. We sort them first by the number of variables (length of the variable part) and then lexicographically by the variable part itself.\n\n### Constructing the Output String:\nFinally, we construct the output string by concatenating the sorted monomials, ensuring that we don't start with a '+' sign if the first coefficient is positive.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Combining Like Terms**: Given an algebraic expression with like terms, combine them to simplify the expression. The solution involves parsing the expression, aggregating like terms, and constructing the simplified expression.\n\n2. **Sorting Variables in Polynomials**: Given a polynomial, sort the variables in each term lexicographically. This problem focuses on the normalization step of the solution.\n\n3. **Polynomial Addition**: Given two polynomials, add them together and simplify the result. This problem combines parsing, aggregation, and sorting steps.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n```python\ndef simplify(poly):\n    # Helper function to normalize and sort the variables in a monomial\n    def normalize(monomial):\n        if monomial[0] in '-+':\n            coefficient = monomial[0]\n            variables = ''.join(sorted(monomial[1:]))\n        else:\n            coefficient = '+'\n            variables = ''.join(sorted(monomial))\n        return coefficient, variables\n\n    # Split the input string into monomials\n    monomials = []\n    i = 0\n    for j in range(1, len(poly)):\n        if poly[j] in '+-':\n            monomials.append(poly[i:j])\n            i = j\n    monomials.append(poly[i:])\n\n    # Aggregate monomials\n    aggregated = {}\n    for monomial in monomials:\n        coefficient, variables = normalize(monomial)\n        coefficient = int(coefficient + '1') if variables else int(coefficient)\n        aggregated[variables] = aggregated.get(variables, 0) + coefficient\n\n    # Sort the aggregated monomials\n    sorted_monomials = sorted(\n        [(coef, var) for var, coef in aggregated.items() if coef != 0],\n        key=lambda x: (len(x[1]), x[1])\n    )\n\n    # Construct the output string\n    result = ''\n    for coef, var in sorted_monomials:\n        if coef == -1:\n            result += '-' + var\n        elif coef == 1:\n            result += '+' + var\n        else:\n            result += f\"{('+' if coef > 0 else '')}{coef}{var}\"\n\n    return result.lstrip('+')\n\n# Main execution\ninput_poly = input()\nprint(simplify(input_poly))\n```\n\nThis code defines the `simplify` function, which takes a string representing a polynomial and returns the simplified version of it.

In Python, strings are immutable sequences of Unicode characters, and Python provides a rich set of methods to work with them.\n\nTo solve the problem at hand, we can use the following string methods:\n- `splitlines()`: Splits a string into a list where each element is a line in the string.\n- `find()`: Searches the string for a specified value and returns the position of where it was found.\n- `rstrip()`: Returns a right trim version of the string, removing any trailing whitespaces or specified characters.\n\nThe algorithm can be implemented as follows:\n1. Split the input string into lines using `splitlines()`.\n2. Iterate over each line and for each comment marker, use `find()` to check if it is present in the line.\n3. If a comment marker is found, slice the line up to the position of the marker.\n4. Use `rstrip()` to remove any trailing whitespace from the line.\n5.

This problem can be solved using a stack to keep track of characters, and when a duplicate is found, it is popped from the stack.\n\n2. **Reverse Words in a String**: Given an input string, reverse the string word by word. This involves splitting the string by spaces, reversing the list of words, and then joining them back together.\n\n3. **Valid Parentheses**: Given a string containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid. An input string is valid if the brackets are closed in the correct order.

Specifically, we are looking at a variant of the Coin Change Problem where we want to find the largest value that cannot be obtained using any combination of the given denominators (coins). This is closely related to the concept of the **Frobenius Number** in mathematics, which is the largest number that cannot be expressed as a linear combination of two or more given numbers with non-negative integer coefficients.\n\n## Tutorial:\nThe Coin Change Problem typically asks for the number of ways to make change for a particular amount given a set of denominations, or the minimum number of coins needed to make that amount. Dynamic programming is often used to solve these problems efficiently.\n\nHowever, in this problem, we are interested in finding the largest number that cannot be formed using any combination of the given numbers. This is a different twist on the problem and requires a different approach.\n\nFor two numbers, the Frobenius number can be calculated directly using the formula `F(a, b) = a * b - a - b` where `a` and `b` are coprime (i.e., their greatest common divisor is 1). However, for more than two numbers, there is no general formula and the problem becomes NP-hard.\n\nOne approach to solve this problem for small sets of numbers is to use a greedy algorithm. The idea is to sort the numbers and then iteratively add the smallest number to a running total until we reach a point where the next number cannot be formed. This works under the condition that the numbers are relatively prime to each other.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Classic Coin Change Problem**: Given an unlimited supply of coins of given denominations, find the total number of distinct ways to get a desired change.\n   Solution: This problem can be solved using dynamic programming by building a table that stores the solutions to subproblems.\n\n2. **Minimum Number of Coins**: Given a value V, if we want to make change for V cents, and we have an infinite supply of each of C = { C1, C2, .. , Cm} valued coins, what is the minimum number of coins to make the change?\n   Solution: This can also be solved using dynamic programming by building a table that stores the minimum number of coins needed for each amount from 0 to V.\n\n3. **Subset Sum Problem**: Given a set of non-negative integers, and a value sum, determine if there is a subset of the given set with sum equal to the given sum.\n   Solution: This problem can be solved using dynamic programming by creating a boolean table that represents the solutions to subproblems.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\nWe will use a greedy algorithm to solve this problem.

For the \"next smaller\" variation, the steps are as follows:\n\n1. Traverse the digits of the number from right to left until you find a digit that is smaller than the digit immediately to its right.\n2.

Reverse the sequence of digits to the right of the original position of the first digit found in step 1.\n6. Ensure that the resulting number does not start with a zero, as this would not be a valid positive integer.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Next Permutation**: Given a sequence of numbers, rearrange it into the next lexicographically greater permutation. The solution involves a similar approach but with the goal of finding the next greater permutation instead of the smaller one.\n\n2. **Permutations of a String**: Given a string, generate all possible permutations of the characters in the string.

Concatenate the processed lines to form the final output.\n\n## Tutorial:\nString manipulation is a common task in programming, and it involves altering, parsing, or analyzing strings in various ways. In Python, strings are immutable, which means that any operation that modifies a string will actually create a new string.\n\nTo solve the problem at hand, we can use the following string methods:\n- `splitlines()`: Splits a string into a list where each element is a line of the string.\n- `find()`: Returns the lowest index of the substring if it is found in a given string. If it's not found, it returns -1.\n- `rstrip()`: Removes any trailing characters (spaces by default) from the end of the string.\n\nWe can iterate over each line, and for each line, we iterate over each comment marker. If the marker is found, we take the substring of the line up to the marker's index and then strip any trailing whitespace.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Remove All Adjacent Duplicates In String:**\n   You are given a string `s` and you need to remove all adjacent pairs of the same character until no such pair exists.\n   Solution: Use a stack to keep track of characters. Iterate over the string, and for each character, if the stack is not empty and the top of the stack is the same as the current character, pop from the stack. Otherwise, push the current character onto the stack. Finally, return the stack as a string.\n\n2. **Simplify Path:**\n   Given an absolute path for a file (Unix-style), simplify it. For example, path = \"/home/\", => \"/home\"; path = \"/../\", => \"/\"; path = \"/home//foo/\", => \"/home/foo\".\n   Solution: Split the path by \"/\", iterate over the segments, and use a stack to build the simplified path. Skip empty segments and \".\" segments. If the segment is \"..\", pop from the stack if it's not empty. Otherwise, push the segment onto the stack. Join the stack with \"/\" to form the simplified path.\n\n3. **Valid Parentheses:**\n   Given a string containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid. An input string is valid if:\n   - Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.\n   - Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.\n   Solution: Use a stack to keep track of opening brackets. Iterate over the string, and for each character, if it's an opening bracket, push it onto the stack. If it's a closing bracket, check if the stack is not empty and the top of the stack is the matching opening bracket. If not, the string is invalid. If the stack is empty at the end, the string is valid.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n```python\ndef solution(input_string, comment_markers):\n    lines = input_string.splitlines()\n    result = []\n\n    for line in lines:\n        # Find the minimum index of any comment marker\n        min_index = len(line)\n        for marker in comment_markers:\n            index = line.find(marker)\n            if index != -1:\n                min_index = min(min_index, index)\n        \n        # Strip from the comment marker to the end and any trailing whitespace\n        result.append(line[:min_index].rstrip())\n\n    return '\\n'.join(result)\n\n# Read input from standard input\ninput_string = input()\ncomment_markers = input().strip(\"[]\").replace(\"'\", \"\").split(\", \")\n\n# Call the function and print the result to standard output\nprint(solution(input_string, comment_markers))\n```\n\nTo use the code above, you would provide the input string and comment markers in the following format:\n```\napples, pears # and bananas\ngrapes\nbananas !apples\n['#', '!']\n```\n\nThe code will then output the processed string with comments removed and trailing whitespace stripped."], "prompt_tokens": [422], "completion_tokens": [893], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": false, "language": "Python3", "task_id": 1613}

For example, if you have three types of fruits (apple, banana, cherry) and you want to select two fruits, the possible combinations with repetition would be: (apple, apple), (apple, banana), (apple, cherry), (banana, banana), (banana, cherry), and (cherry, cherry).\n\nThe stars and bars method is a visual way to represent combinations with repetition. Imagine you have n stars and you want to divide them into k groups. You can do this by placing k-1 bars among the stars to separate the groups.

It is applicable when the problem can be divided into overlapping subproblems that can be solved independently. The key idea is to store the results of these subproblems in a table (usually an array) so that when the same subproblem occurs, it does not have to be recalculated.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Climbing Stairs**: You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top. Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top? This problem can be solved using dynamic programming by recognizing that the number of ways to reach step i is the sum of the ways to reach step i-1 and i-2.\n\n2. **Coin Change**: You are given coins of different denominations and a total amount of money amount. Write a function to compute the number of combinations that make up that amount. This problem can be solved using dynamic programming by building a table that represents the number of ways to make up amounts from 0 to the given amount using the available coins.\n\n3. **Unique Paths in a Grid**: A robot is located at the top-left corner of a m x n grid. The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid. How many possible unique paths are there?

The problem can be seen as finding the minimum number of coins (perfect squares in this case) that sum up to a given amount (n). However, there are some mathematical optimizations that can be applied to this problem due to the nature of perfect squares.\n\n## Tutorial:\nDynamic programming is a method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems. It is applicable to problems exhibiting the properties of overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure. When subproblems are solved, their solutions are stored in a table, so they do not have to be recomputed when needed later.\n\nFor the sum of squares problem, we can use dynamic programming to find the minimum number of perfect squares that sum up to the given number n. The idea is to create an array dp where dp[i] represents the minimum number of perfect squares that sum up to i. We initialize dp[0] to 0 and the rest of the elements to infinity (or a large number). Then, for each perfect square number j*j (where j*j <= n), we update the dp array as follows:\n\n```\nfor i from j*j to n:\n    dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - j*j] + 1)\n```\n\nThis ensures that dp[i] will hold the minimum number of perfect squares needed to sum up to i.\n\nHowever, there is a mathematical theorem by Lagrange that states every natural number can be represented as the sum of four integer squares. This means that the answer for any n will always be between 1 and 4. We can use this fact to optimize our solution:\n\n1. If n is a perfect square, return 1.\n2. Check if n can be expressed as the sum of two perfect squares.\n3. Check if n can be expressed as the sum of three perfect squares.\n4. If none of the above conditions are met, return 4.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Coin Change Problem**: Given an unlimited supply of coins of given denominations, find the minimum number of coins required to make a change for a given value.\n   Solution: Use dynamic programming to build up a solution for each value from 1 to the given value.\n   \n2. **Minimum Path Sum in a Triangle**: Given a triangle, find the minimum path sum from top to bottom. Each step you may move to adjacent numbers on the row below.\n   Solution: Use dynamic programming to keep track of the minimum path sum to each position in the triangle as you move downwards.\n\n3. **Combination Sum IV**: Given an integer array with all positive numbers and no duplicates, find the number of possible combinations that add up to a positive integer target.\n   Solution: Use dynamic programming to build an array where the value at each index represents the number of combinations to reach that index.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\nWe will implement the optimized solution based on the mathematical theorem mentioned above.

Once the GCD is found, the smallest possible sum is simply the GCD multiplied by the number of elements in the array.\n\n## Tutorial:\nThe Euclidean algorithm is an efficient method for computing the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers, the largest number that divides both of them without leaving a remainder. It is based on the principle that the GCD of two numbers also divides their difference.\n\nHere's how the Euclidean algorithm works:\n1. Given two positive integers, a and b, where a > b, subtract b from a. The difference replaces a.\n2. Repeat this process until a equals b. That common value then becomes the GCD.\n3.

A more efficient approach is to recognize that green numbers follow a certain sequence and can be generated iteratively.\n\n## Tutorial:\nTo solve this problem efficiently, we need to understand the properties of 'green' numbers. One key observation is that if a number `N` is green, then `N\u00b2` ends with `N`. This implies that `N` must be congruent to its square modulo some power of 10. For example, if `N` is a 3-digit number, then `N` must be congruent to `N\u00b2` modulo 1000.\n\nAnother observation is that green numbers are relatively rare, and they follow a specific sequence. The first few green numbers are 1, 5, 6, 25, 76, 376, and so on. By examining this sequence, we can notice that each green number can be used to find the next one by appending certain digits to it and checking if the new number is green.\n\nThe algorithm to find the `n`th green number is as follows:\n1. Start with a list of known green numbers (e.g., [1, 5, 6]).\n2. Generate the next green number by trying to append digits to the last known green number and checking if the new number is green.\n3. Repeat step 2 until we have generated `n` green numbers.\n4. Return the `n`th green number.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Automorphic Numbers**: An automorphic number is a number whose square \"ends\" in the same digits as the number itself. The task is to find the first `n` automorphic numbers. The solution involves a similar approach to finding green numbers, checking for the property that defines an automorphic number.\n\n2. **Cyclic Numbers**: A cyclic number is an integer in which cyclic permutations of the digits are successive multiples of the number. The task is to find whether a given number is cyclic. The solution involves generating multiples of the number and checking if the digits are a cyclic permutation of the original number.\n\n3. **Kaprekar Numbers**: A Kaprekar number is a non-negative integer, the representation of whose square in that base can be split into two parts that add up to the original number. The task is to find all Kaprekar numbers in a given range. The solution involves squaring each number in the range and checking if it satisfies the Kaprekar property.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\nWe will use a list to store the known green numbers.

It is applicable to problems exhibiting the properties of overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure. When applied to counting subsequences, we use an array to keep track of the number of ways to form each prefix of the `needle` using characters from the `haystack`.\n\nTo count the number of times a `needle` occurs as a subsequence in a `haystack`, we can initialize an array `dp` of length equal to the length of `needle` plus one. `dp[0]` is set to 1, because there is exactly one way to form an empty subsequence. For each character in the `haystack`, we iterate backwards through the `needle`. If the current character in the `haystack` matches the character in the `needle`, we update `dp[i]` by adding the value of `dp[i-1]` to it. This represents the number of ways to extend the subsequences ending just before the current character in the `needle`.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Count Distinct Subsequences**: Given a string, count the number of distinct subsequences of it (including the empty subsequence).

We will calculate the combinations with repetition for increasing numbers and then add the combinations for decreasing numbers, making sure to subtract the double-counted numbers (all identical digits).\n\n```python\nfrom math import factorial\n\ndef nCr(n, r):\n    return factorial(n) // (factorial(r) * factorial(n - r))\n\ndef total_inc_dec(x):\n    # For increasing numbers, we use combinations with repetition\n    # We have 10 digits and x positions, so we calculate 10 multichoose x (n+r-1 choose r)\n    increasing = nCr(10 + x - 1, x)\n    \n    # For decreasing numbers, we also use combinations with repetition\n    # But we have 9 digits (1-9) and x positions, because leading zeros are not considered\n    decreasing = nCr(9 + x - 1, x)\n    \n    # We subtract the numbers with all identical digits since they are counted in both increasing and decreasing\n    # There are 10 such numbers for each digit length (0, 11, 222, ..., 9999999999)\n    all_identical = 10 if x > 0 else 1\n    \n    return increasing + decreasing - all_identical\n\n# Read input from standard input\nx = int(input())\n\n# Call the function and print the output to standard output\nprint(total_inc_dec(x))\n```\n\nThis code defines a helper function `nCr` to calculate the binomial coefficient, which is used to compute the number of combinations. The `total_inc_dec` function then calculates the total number of increasing and decreasing numbers below 10 raised to the xth power and prints the result."], "prompt_tokens": [948], "completion_tokens": [832], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": false, "language": "Python3", "task_id": 1634}
{"name": "1627", "description": "### Background\n\nI was reading a [book](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Things-Make-Do-Fourth-Dimension/dp/1846147646/) recently, \"Things to Make and Do in the Fourth Dimension\" by comedian and mathematician Matt Parker, and in the first chapter of the book Matt talks about problems he likes to solve in his head to take his mind off the fact that he is in his dentist's chair, we've all been there!\n\nThe problem he talks about relates to polydivisible numbers, and I thought a kata should be written on the subject as it's quite interesting. (Well it's interesting to me, so there!)\n\n### Polydivisib... huh what?\n\nSo what are they?\n\nA polydivisible number is divisible in an unusual way. The first digit is cleanly divisible by `1`, the first two digits are cleanly divisible by `2`, the first three by `3` and so on.\n\nThe interesting thing about polydivisiblity is that it relates to the underlying number, but not the base it is written in, so if aliens came to Earth and used base `23` (`11` fingers on one hand and `12` on the other), no matter what squiggles they use to write numbers, they would find the same numbers polydivisible!\n\n### Polydivisibilty Example:\n\nLet's do a worked example to clear up any questions ...\n\nStarting wih the number `1,232` in base `10` then:\n\n```\n 1232\n 1    /1 = 1    Yay!\n 12   /2 = 6    Yay!\n 123  /3 = 41   Yay!\n 1232 /4 = 308  Yay!\n```\n\nThus `1,232` is a polydivisible number in base `4` and above.\n\nHowever starting wih the number `123,220` and using base `10` then:\n\n```\n 123220\n 1      /1 = 1            Yay!\n 12     /2 = 6            Yay!\n 123    /3 = 41           Yay!\n 1232   /4 = 308          Yay!\n 12322  /5 = 2464.4       Oh no, that's not a round number!\n 123220 /6 = 220536.333r  Oh no, that's not a round number!\n```\n\nThus `123,220` is not a polydivisible base 10 number, but what about in another base?\n\nAgain starting wih the number `123,220` and using base `6` then:\n\n```\n base 6   base 10\n 1      = 1       -> 1     /1 = 1     Yay!\n 12     = 8       -> 8     /2 = 4     Yay!\n 123    = 51      -> 51    /3 = 17    Yay!\n 1232   = 308     -> 308   /4 = 77    Yay!\n 12322  = 1850    -> 1850  /5 = 370   Yay!\n 123220 = 11100   -> 11100 /6 = 1850  Yay!\n```\n\nThus `123,220` is a polydivisible base `6` number (and a polydivisible base `10` number when converted to `11100` in base `10`).\n\n### Kata\n\nIn this kata you must implement two methods: `is_polydivisible(n, b)` and `get_polydivisible(n, b)`.\n\nThe first `is_polydivisible(n, b)` will return `True` if `n` is polydivisible in base `b` or `False` if not.\n\nThe second `get_polydivisible(n, b)` will return the `n`th polydivisible number using base `b`, the first polydivisible number is of course always `0`.\n\nYou can assume that all inputs are valid.\n\n```if:haskell\nAll necessary arithmetic can be done in `Int` range.\n```\n\n### Kata Examples:\n\n```python\n    is_polydivisible(\"1232\", 10)   # => True\n    is_polydivisible(\"123220\", 10) # => False\n    is_polydivisible(\"123220\", 6)  # => True\n    get_polydivisible(22, 10)      # => \"32\"\n    get_polydivisible(22, 16)      # => \"1A\"\n    get_polydivisible(42, 16)      # => \"42\"\n```\n\n#### A Note on Bases\n\nThe maximum base used is base `62`, and uses characters in the following order `[0-9][A-Z][a-z]` to denote its digits, base `n` will use the first `n` characters of this sequence.\n```if-not:haskell\nA constant CHARS has been declared with this sequence for you.\n```", "difficulty": "interview", "id": 1627, "sample_io": [{"input": "123\n10", "output": [true]}, {"input": "1234\n10", "output": [false]}], "test_list": [{"input": "123\n10", "output": [true]}, {"input": "1234\n10", "output": [false]}, {"input": "12345\n10", "output": [false]}, {"input": "12365\n10", "output": [true]}, {"input": "123220\n10", "output": [false]}, {"input": "50041\n6", "output": [true]}, {"input": "140410\n6", "output": [true]}, {"input": "203230\n6", "output": [true]}, {"input": "30043052\n6", "output": [true]}], "starter_code": "\ndef is_polydivisible(s, b):\n\t", "source_codes": ["\nCHARS = \"0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\"\n\ndef is_polydivisible(s, b):\n    num = 0\n    for i in range(len(s)):\n        num = num * b + CHARS.index(s[i])\n        if num % (i + 1) != 0:\n            return False\n    return True\n\ndef get_polydivisible(n, b):\n    if n == 1:\n        return \"0\"\n    count = 1  # Starting with 0 as the first polydivisible number\n    num = 1\n    while count < n:\n        num += 1\n        if is_polydivisible(base_convert(num, b), b):\n            count += 1\n    return base_convert(num, b)\n\ndef base_convert(num, b):\n    if num == 0:\n        return CHARS[0]\n    digits = \"\"\n    while num:\n        digits = CHARS[num % b] + digits\n        num //= b\n    return digits\n\n# Read input from standard input\ns = input().strip()\nb = int(input().strip())\n\n# Call the function and print the result to standard output\nprint(is_polydivisible(s, b))\n\n\n"], "responses": ["## Algorithms:\nThe core concepts used to solve the problem are:\n1.

Iteration: Iteratively checking each condition for polydivisibility.\n4. String manipulation: Handling numbers as strings to easily access individual digits.\n\n## Tutorial:\n### Base Conversion:\nBase conversion is the process of changing the base of a number. For example, converting a number from base 10 to base 2. This is often done by dividing the number by the new base and keeping track of the remainders, which form the digits of the new base number.\n\n### Modular Arithmetic:\nModular arithmetic involves operations with remainders. It is often used to check divisibility. A number `a` is divisible by `b` if `a % b == 0`, where `%` is the modulo operator that gives the remainder of the division of `a` by `b`.\n\n### Iteration:\nIteration is the process of repeating a set of instructions until a certain condition is met. In the context of checking for polydivisibility, we iterate through the digits of a number, checking the divisibility condition at each step.\n\n### String Manipulation:\nString manipulation involves operations on strings, such as accessing, slicing, and concatenating. In this problem, we treat the number as a string to easily access its individual digits and substrings representing the number at each stage of divisibility checking.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Base Conversion Problem**: Given a number in base 10, convert it to base 2.\n   - Solution: Repeatedly divide the number by 2 and keep track of the remainders. Reverse the remainders to get the number in base 2.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def convert_to_base2(n):\n         if n == 0:\n             return \"0\"\n         result = \"\"\n         while n > 0:\n             result = str(n % 2) + result\n             n //= 2\n         return result\n     ```\n\n2. **Divisibility Check**: Given a list of numbers, return those that are divisible by a given divisor.\n   - Solution: Use modular arithmetic to check each number for divisibility.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def find_divisible_numbers(numbers, divisor):\n         return [num for num in numbers if num % divisor == 0]\n     ```\n\n3. **Finding the nth Prime Number**: Write a function to find the nth prime number.\n   - Solution: Use a sieve algorithm or iterative checking of divisibility to find all prime numbers up to the nth prime.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def is_prime(num):\n         if num <= 1:\n             return False\n         for i in range(2, int(num**0.5) + 1):\n             if num % i == 0:\n                 return False\n         return True\n\n     def nth_prime(n):\n         count = 0\n         num = 2\n         while True:\n             if is_prime(num):\n                 count += 1\n                 if count == n:\n                     return num\n             num += 1\n     ```\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n### Explanation of the solution:\nTo solve the `is_polydivisible` problem, we need to check each prefix of the number (as a string) to see if it is divisible by its position. For `get_polydivisible`, we need to generate polydivisible numbers in the given base until we reach the nth one.\n\n### Python3 code:\n```python\nCHARS = \"0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\"\n\ndef is_polydivisible(s, b):\n    num = 0\n    for i in range(len(s)):\n        num = num * b + CHARS.index(s[i])\n        if num % (i + 1) != 0:\n            return False\n    return True\n\ndef get_polydivisible(n, b):\n    if n == 1:\n        return \"0\"\n    count = 1  # Starting with 0 as the first polydivisible number\n    num = 1\n    while count < n:\n        num += 1\n        if is_polydivisible(base_convert(num, b), b):\n            count += 1\n    return base_convert(num, b)\n\ndef base_convert(num, b):\n    if num == 0:\n        return CHARS[0]\n    digits = \"\"\n    while num:\n        digits = CHARS[num % b] + digits\n        num //= b\n    return digits\n\n# Read input from standard input\ns = input().strip()\nb = int(input().strip())\n\n# Call the function and print the result to standard output\nprint(is_polydivisible(s, b))\n```\n\nThis code defines two functions, `is_polydivisible` and `get_polydivisible`, as well as a helper function `base_convert` to convert numbers to a given base using the specified character set.

The idea is to iterate over the `haystack` string and, for each character, update the count of subsequences that can be formed up to that point which match the `needle`.\n\n## Tutorial:\nDynamic programming is a method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems. It is applicable to problems exhibiting the properties of overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure. When solving a problem using dynamic programming, you store the solutions to subproblems so that when the same subproblem occurs, you can use the stored solution instead of recalculating it.\n\nFor counting subsequences, we can use a table (or an array) to keep track of the number of ways to form the `needle` up to each point in the `haystack`. We initialize an array `dp` with length equal to the length of `needle` plus one, where `dp[0]` is set to 1 (since there is one way to form an empty subsequence), and the rest are initialized to 0.\n\nAs we iterate over the `haystack`, for each character, we check if it matches a character in the `needle`. If it does, we update the `dp` array such that `dp[i]` is increased by `dp[i-1]` (where `i` is the index in `needle` of the matched character). This is because the number of ways to form the subsequence up to the `i`-th character in `needle` is increased by the number of ways to form the subsequence up to the `(i-1)`-th character.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Count Distinct Subsequences**: Given a string, count the number of distinct subsequences of it (including the empty subsequence). The solution involves a similar dynamic programming approach where you keep track of the count of subsequences ending with each character.\n\n2. **Longest Common Subsequence**: Given two strings, find the length of the longest subsequence present in both of them. A subsequence is a sequence that appears in the same relative order, but not necessarily contiguous.\n\n3. **Subsequence Pattern Matching**: Given a pattern and a string, count the number of times the pattern appears as a subsequence in the string. This is very similar to the original problem but may involve multiple patterns or a more complex pattern.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\nWe will create a dynamic programming solution that iterates over the `haystack` and updates the count of subsequences that match the `needle` at each step.

used to solve this problem is the implementation of a Finite State Machine (FSM). An FSM is an abstract machine that can be in exactly one of a finite number of states at any given time. The FSM can change from one state to another in response to some external inputs; this change is called a transition. An FSM is defined by a list of its states, its initial state, and the conditions for each transition.\n\n## Tutorial:\nFinite State Machines are a fundamental concept used in computer science for modeling behavior and designing systems. They are widely used in various applications, such as digital circuits, computer programs, and, as in this case, network protocols.\n\nAn FSM consists of the following components:\n- States: A finite set of states the machine can be in.\n- Initial state: The state in which the machine starts.\n- Transitions: A set of rules that define how the machine moves from one state to another based on input events.\n\nTo implement an FSM in Python, you can follow these steps:\n1. Define the states and the initial state.\n2. Create a dictionary (or any other suitable data structure) to represent the transitions, where the keys are tuples of the current state and the event, and the values are the resulting states.\n3. Iterate over the input events, and for each event, update the current state based on the transition rules.\n4. If an event does not lead to a valid transition for the current state, return an error.\n5. After processing all events, return the final state.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Traffic Light Controller**: Design an FSM to simulate a traffic light system at a pedestrian crossing. The system changes lights from green to yellow to red and back to green, with the possibility of a pedestrian request to cross the road.\n   \n2. **Vending Machine**: Implement an FSM for a vending machine that dispenses products when the correct value is entered and gives change if necessary. The machine should handle events like inserting coins, selecting a product, and dispensing items.\n\n3. **Turnstile**: Model a turnstile that can be in a locked or unlocked state. The turnstile can be pushed to rotate only if it is unlocked. Inserting a coin or pushing the turnstile are the input events.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\nThe solution involves creating a dictionary that maps the transitions based on the current state and the event. We will iterate over the input events, updating the current state according to the transition rules. If an event is not applicable, we will return \"ERROR\". If all events are processed successfully, we will return the final state.\n\n```python\ndef tcp_fsm(events):\n    states = {\n        ('CLOSED', 'APP_PASSIVE_OPEN'): 'LISTEN',\n        ('CLOSED', 'APP_ACTIVE_OPEN'): 'SYN_SENT',\n        ('LISTEN', 'RCV_SYN'): 'SYN_RCVD',\n        ('LISTEN', 'APP_SEND'): 'SYN_SENT',\n        ('LISTEN', 'APP_CLOSE'): 'CLOSED',\n        ('SYN_RCVD', 'APP_CLOSE'): 'FIN_WAIT_1',\n        ('SYN_RCVD', 'RCV_ACK'): 'ESTABLISHED',\n        ('SYN_SENT', 'RCV_SYN'): 'SYN_RCVD',\n        ('SYN_SENT', 'RCV_SYN_ACK'): 'ESTABLISHED',\n        ('SYN_SENT', 'APP_CLOSE'): 'CLOSED',\n        ('ESTABLISHED', 'APP_CLOSE'): 'FIN_WAIT_1',\n        ('ESTABLISHED', 'RCV_FIN'): 'CLOSE_WAIT',\n        ('FIN_WAIT_1', 'RCV_FIN'): 'CLOSING',\n        ('FIN_WAIT_1', 'RCV_FIN_ACK'): 'TIME_WAIT',\n        ('FIN_WAIT_1', 'RCV_ACK'): 'FIN_WAIT_2',\n        ('CLOSING', 'RCV_ACK'): 'TIME_WAIT',\n        ('FIN_WAIT_2', 'RCV_FIN'): 'TIME_WAIT',\n        ('TIME_WAIT', 'APP_TIMEOUT'): 'CLOSED',\n        ('CLOSE_WAIT', 'APP_CLOSE'): 'LAST_ACK',\n        ('LAST_ACK', 'RCV_ACK'): 'CLOSED',\n    }\n    \n    current_state = 'CLOSED'\n    for event in events:\n        if (current_state, event) in states:\n            current_state = states[(current_state, event)]\n        else:\n            return \"ERROR\"\n    return current_state\n\n# Read input, process the events, and print the final state\nevents = input().strip().split(',')\nfinal_state = tcp_fsm(events)\nprint(final_state)\n```\n\nThis code defines the FSM for the TCP session and processes a list of events to determine the final state of the session.

A brute force approach would be to check each number by squaring it and comparing the last digits with the number itself. However, this would be inefficient for large values of `n`. Instead, we can use mathematical properties and patterns to find green numbers more efficiently.\n\n## Tutorial:\nTo solve this problem, we need to understand the properties of 'green' numbers. One key observation is that green numbers follow a certain pattern and are relatively rare. We can use this pattern to generate green numbers without checking every single number.\n\nOne approach is to use string manipulation to check if the square of a number ends with the number itself. However, this is not efficient for large numbers. A more efficient approach is to use modular arithmetic. We can check if a number is green by squaring it and then taking the modulus with a power of 10 that has the same number of digits as the number itself. If the result equals the original number, it is green.\n\nFor example, to check if 376 is green, we calculate 376\u00b2 = 141376 and then take 141376 mod 1000 (since 376 has three digits). The result is 376, which matches the original number, confirming that it is green.\n\nTo find the nth green number, we can use a loop to generate green numbers until we reach the nth one. We can also optimize the search by noticing that green numbers often end with certain digits, such as 25, 76, etc., and increment our search accordingly.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Automorphic Numbers**: An automorphic number is a number whose square \"ends\" in the same digits as the number itself. The problem is to find the first `n` automorphic numbers. The solution involves checking each number using modular arithmetic until `n` automorphic numbers are found.\n\n2. **Cyclic Numbers**: A cyclic number is an integer in which cyclic permutations of the digits are successive multiples of the number. The problem is to find the first `n` cyclic numbers. The solution involves generating multiples of the number and checking if the digits cycle.\n\n3. **Kaprekar Numbers**: A Kaprekar number is a non-negative integer, the representation of whose square in that base can be split into two parts that add up to the original number. The problem is to find all Kaprekar numbers in a given range. The solution involves squaring each number in the range and checking if the sum of its split parts equals the original number.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\nTo solve the original problem, we will use a loop to generate green numbers. We will keep track of the last found green number and use modular arithmetic to check if the next number is green.

Dynamic programming is a method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems. It is applicable when the problem can be divided into overlapping subproblems that can be solved independently.\n\nThe coin change problem is a classic example of dynamic programming where we want to find the number of ways to make change for a certain amount of money given a set of denominations. The problem has optimal substructure, meaning the solution can be constructed from solutions of its subproblems, and it has overlapping subproblems, meaning the same subproblems are solved multiple times.\n\n## Tutorial:\nDynamic programming problems typically require you to store the results of subproblems so that you don't have to recompute them when they are needed again. This is often done using an array or a dictionary where the index or key represents the subproblem, and the value represents the solution to that subproblem.\n\nFor the coin change problem, we can use a bottom-up approach where we start with the smallest subproblems and build up to the problem we want to solve. We create an array `dp` where `dp[i]` will represent the number of ways to make change for the amount `i`. We initialize `dp[0]` to 1 because there is one way to make change for zero amount (which is to use no coins).\n\nWe then iterate over each coin denomination and update the array for all amounts that can be reached by using that denomination. For each coin, we iterate through all the amounts from the coin's value up to the target amount, updating the number of ways to make change for each amount.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Minimum Number of Coins**: Given an amount and an array of coin denominations, find the minimum number of coins that you need to make up that amount. The solution involves a similar dynamic programming approach where you keep track of the minimum number of coins needed for each amount up to the target.\n\n2. **Maximum Ways to Make Change**: Given an amount and an array of coin denominations, find the maximum number of ways you can make change if each coin is limited in quantity. This problem extends the coin change problem by adding a constraint on the number of coins available.\n\n3. **Subset Sum Problem**: Given a set of non-negative integers and a value sum, determine if there is a subset of the given set with a sum equal to the given sum. This problem is similar in that it also uses dynamic programming to build up a solution based on smaller subproblems.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\nWe will create a function `count_change` that initializes a list `dp` of length `amount + 1` with zeros and sets `dp[0]` to 1. We then iterate over each coin denomination and for each denomination, we iterate through the amounts from the coin's value up to the target amount. For each amount, we add the number of ways to make change without using the current coin (which is already stored in `dp`) to the number of ways to make change using the current coin.\n\nHere's the Python3 code:\n\n```python\ndef count_change(amount, coins):\n    dp = [0] * (amount + 1)\n    dp[0] = 1\n    \n    for coin in coins:\n        for i in range(coin, amount + 1):\n            dp[i] += dp[i - coin]\n    \n    return dp[amount]\n\n# Taking input from standard input and printing the output\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    amount = int(input())\n    coins = list(map(int, input().strip('[]').split(',')))\n    print(count_change(amount, coins))\n```\n\nTo use this code, you would run the script and input the amount and the coin denominations in the format specified in the problem statement.

Specifically, we will use a 2D DP table to keep track of the number of ways to reach each cell, considering the constraints imposed by the rocks.\n\n## Tutorial:\nDynamic programming is a method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems. It is applicable when the problem can be divided into overlapping subproblems that can be solved independently.\n\nIn the context of grid-based problems like the one described, DP is often used to find the number of ways to reach a particular cell from a starting cell, given certain movement restrictions. The idea is to start from the base case (the starting cell) and build up the solution by solving for each cell in a bottom-up manner.\n\nFor each cell, we consider the number of ways to reach it from the cell above and the cell to the left (since we can only move right or down). If a cell contains a rock, we need to account for the rock being pushed to the next cell. This means that if we move right into a cell with a rock, we must ensure that the cell to the right of it is within the grid and does not contain another rock. The same logic applies when moving down.\n\nThe DP state can be defined as `dp[i][j]`, which represents the number of ways to reach cell `(i, j)` from the starting cell `(1, 1)`. The recurrence relation to fill the DP table is based on the above considerations.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Unique Paths in a Grid**: Given an `m x n` grid filled with non-negative numbers, find a path from top left to bottom right which minimizes the sum of all numbers along its path. You can only move either down or right at any point in time.\n\n   Solution: Use a 2D DP table where `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum sum of all numbers from the start to cell `(i, j)`. The recurrence relation is `dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]) + grid[i][j]`.\n\n2. **Minimum Path Sum**: Similar to the Unique Paths problem, but instead of counting the number of paths, calculate the minimum path sum from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner of a grid.\n\n   Solution: This problem is solved using a similar DP approach as the Unique Paths problem, with the difference being that we keep track of the minimum sum instead of the number of ways.\n\n3. **Longest Increasing Path in a Matrix**: Given an `m x n` integers matrix, return the length of the longest increasing path in the matrix. From each cell, you can either move in four directions: left, right, up, or down.\n\n   Solution: Use memoization to store the length of the longest increasing path starting from each cell. Perform a depth-first search (DFS) from each cell, and use the stored values to avoid re-computation.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n```python\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\ndef count_legal_paths(n, m, labyrinth):\n    dp = [[0] * m for _ in range(n)]\n    dp[0][0] = 1  # Starting cell\n\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(m):\n            if labyrinth[i][j] == 'R':\n                if i + 1 < n and labyrinth[i + 1][j] != 'R':\n                    dp[i + 1][j] = (dp[i + 1][j] + dp[i][j]) % MOD\n                if j + 1 < m and labyrinth[i][j + 1] != 'R':\n                    dp[i][j + 1] = (dp[i][j + 1] + dp[i][j]) % MOD\n            else:\n                if i + 1 < n:\n                    dp[i + 1][j] = (dp[i + 1][j] + dp[i][j]) % MOD\n                if j + 1 < m:\n                    dp[i][j + 1] = (dp[i][j + 1] + dp[i][j]) % MOD\n\n    return dp[n - 1][m - 1]\n\n# Read input and call the function\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\nlabyrinth = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\nresult = count_legal_paths(n, m, labyrinth)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code defines a function `count_legal_paths` that takes the dimensions of the labyrinth and the labyrinth itself as input.

{"name": "1622", "description": "# Ten-Pin Bowling\n\nIn the game of ten-pin bowling, a player rolls a bowling ball down a lane to knock over pins. There are ten pins set at the end of the bowling lane. Each player has 10 frames to roll a bowling ball down a lane and knock over as many pins as possible. The first nine frames are ended after two rolls or when the player knocks down all the pins. The last frame a player will receive an extra roll every time they knock down all ten pins; up to a maximum of three total rolls. \n\n## The Challenge\n\nIn this challenge you will be given a string representing a player's ten frames. It will look something like this: `'X X 9/ 80 X X 90 8/ 7/ 44'` (in Java: `\"X X 9/ 80 X X 90 8/ 7/ 44\"`), where each frame is space-delimited, `'X'` represents strikes, and `'/'` represents spares. Your goal is take in this string of frames into a function called `bowlingScore` and return the players total score.\n\n## Scoring\n\nThe scoring for ten-pin bowling can be difficult to understand, and if you're like most people, easily forgotten if you don't play often. Here is a quick breakdown:\n\n### Frames\n\nIn Ten-Pin Bowling there are ten frames per game. Frames are the players turn to bowl, which can be multiple rolls. The first 9 frames you get 2 rolls maximum to try to get all 10 pins down. **On the 10th or last frame a player will receive an extra roll each time they get all ten pins down to a maximum of three total rolls. Also on the last frame bonuses are not awarded for strikes and spares moving forward.**\n\nIn this challenge, three frames might be represented like this: `54 72 44`. In this case, the player has had three frames. On their first frame they scored 9 points (5 + 4), on their second frame they scored 9 points (7 + 2) and on their third frame they scored 8 points (4 + 4). This is a very simple example of bowling scoring. It gets more complicated when we introduce strikes and spares.\n\n### Strikes \nRepresented in this challenge as `'X'`\n\nA strike is scored when a player knocks all ten pins down in one roll. In the first 9 frames this will conclude the players turn and it will be scored as 10 points plus the points received from the next two rolls. So if a player were to have two frames `X 54`, the total score of those two frames would be 28. The first frame would be worth 19 (10 + 5 + 4) and the second frame would be worth 9 (5 + 4).\n\nA perfect game in bowling is 12 strikes in a row and would be represented like this `'X X X X X X X X X XXX'` (in Java: `\"X X X X X X X X X XXX\"`). This adds up to a total score of 300.\n\n### Spares\nRepresented in this challenge as `'/'`\n\nA spare is scored when a player knocks down all ten pins in two rolls. In the first 9 frames this will be scored as 10 points plus the next roll. So if a player were to have two frames `9/ 54`, the total score of the two frames would be 24. The first frame would be worth 15 (10 + 5) and the second frame would be worth 9 (5 + 4).\n\nFor a more detailed explanation see Wikipedia: \n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten-pin_bowling#Scoring", "difficulty": "interview", "id": 1622, "sample_io": [{"input": "11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11", "output": [20]}, {"input": "X X X X X X X X X XXX", "output": [300]}], "test_list": [{"input": "11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11", "output": [20]}, {"input": "X X X X X X X X X XXX", "output": [300]}, {"input": "00 5/ 4/ 53 33 22 4/ 5/ 45 XXX", "output": [115]}, {"input": "5/ 4/ 3/ 2/ 1/ 0/ X 9/ 4/ 8/8", "output": [150]}, {"input": "5/ 4/ 3/ 2/ 1/ 0/ X 9/ 4/ 7/2", "output": [143]}, {"input": "X X 9/ 80 X X 90 8/ 7/ 44", "output": [171]}, {"input": "6/ 5/ 6/ 2/ 3/ 0/ 1/ 8/ 3/ 6/5", "output": [139]}, {"input": "00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 0/X", "output": [20]}, {"input": "00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 X 0/X", "output": [40]}], "starter_code": "\ndef bowling_score(frames):\n\t", "source_codes": ["\ndef bowlingScore(frames):\n    # Split the frames into a list\n    frames_list = frames.split()\n    score = 0\n    roll_index = 0\n    rolls = []\n\n    # Flatten the frames into individual rolls\n    for frame in frames_list:\n        if frame == 'X':  # Strike\n            rolls.extend(['X', '0'])  # Add a zero roll for easier indexing\n        else:\n            rolls.extend(list(frame))\n\n    # Calculate the score\n    for frame_index in range(10):\n        if rolls[roll_index] == 'X':  # Strike\n            score += 10 + strike_bonus(rolls, roll_index)\n            roll_index += 2\n        elif rolls[roll_index + 1] == '/':  # Spare\n            score += 10 + spare_bonus(rolls, roll_index)\n            roll_index += 2\n        else:  # Normal frame\n            score += sum([int(roll) for roll in rolls[roll_index:roll_index+2]])\n            roll_index += 2\n\n    return score\n\ndef strike_bonus(rolls, index):\n    bonus = 0\n    if rolls[index + 2] == 'X':\n        bonus += 10\n    else:\n        bonus += int(rolls[index + 2])\n    if rolls[index + 3] == '/' or rolls[index + 3] == 'X':\n        bonus += 10 - int(rolls[index + 2])\n    else:\n        bonus += int(rolls[index + 3])\n    return bonus\n\ndef spare_bonus(rolls, index):\n    if rolls[index + 2] == 'X':\n        return 10\n    else:\n        return int(rolls[index + 2])\n\n# Read input and call the function\ninput_frames = input().strip()\nprint(bowlingScore(input_frames))\n\n\n"], "responses": ["## Algorithms:\nThe core concept to solve the Ten-Pin Bowling problem is to parse the input string and calculate the score based on the rules of bowling.

Each frame will be a string that needs to be processed to calculate the score.\n\n2. **Handling Strikes**: When a strike is encountered ('X'), the score for that frame is 10 plus the score of the next two rolls. You need to look ahead to the next frames to calculate this bonus.\n\n3. **Handling Spares**: When a spare is encountered ('/'), the score for that frame is 10 plus the score of the next roll. Again, you need to look ahead to the next frame to calculate this bonus.\n\n4. **Handling Normal Rolls**: If neither a strike nor a spare is scored, the frame's score is the sum of the two rolls.\n\n5. **Tenth Frame Special Case**: In the tenth frame, if a strike or spare is scored, the player gets additional rolls, and the frame can have up to three rolls. The score calculation for the tenth frame does not extend beyond the frame itself.\n\n6. **Calculating the Total Score**: Iterate through each frame, apply the rules for strikes, spares, and normal rolls, and accumulate the total score.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Single-Player Bowling Game**: Similar to the Ten-Pin Bowling problem, but with the additional complexity of handling different symbols for gutter balls or different scoring annotations.\n\n2. **Scoring a Game of Darts**: In a game of darts, players throw darts at a board to score points. The scoring system is different but involves similar concepts of parsing input and applying rules to calculate the score.\n\n3. **Calculating Cricket Scores**: In cricket, scoring involves runs, wickets, and extras. The problem would involve parsing a series of events and calculating the total score, taking into account the various rules of cricket scoring.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\nThe solution involves iterating over each frame, checking for strikes, spares, and normal rolls, and calculating the score accordingly.

An FSM is an abstract machine that can be in exactly one of a finite number of states at any given time. The FSM can change from one state to another in response to some external inputs; this change is called a transition. The FSM is defined by a list of its states, its initial state, and the conditions for each transition.\n\n## Tutorial:\nFinite State Machines are a fundamental concept used in computer science for modeling behavior. An FSM is composed of the following:\n\n- States: A finite set of states the machine can be in.\n- Initial State: The state in which the machine starts.\n- Events: Inputs that can trigger transitions from one state to another.\n- Transitions: The rules that specify which state to move to based on the current state and the event received.\n\nTo implement an FSM in Python, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Define the states and events.\n2. Create a transition table that maps a pair of (current state, event) to a new state.\n3. Initialize the FSM with a starting state.\n4. Create a function that takes an event as input and changes the state of the FSM according to the transition table.\n5. If an event does not lead to a valid transition, return an error or handle it appropriately.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Traffic Light Controller**: A simple FSM problem where you have to simulate a traffic light system. The states could be RED, GREEN, and YELLOW, and the events could be timers that indicate when to change from one state to another.\n\n2. **Vending Machine Operation**: Another FSM problem where the states represent the amount of money inserted into the machine and the events are the insertion of coins or the selection of an item. The transitions would represent adding money, returning change, or dispensing an item.\n\n3. **Turnstile State Machine**: A turnstile has two states, Locked and Unlocked. It has two inputs: inserting a coin and pushing the arm. The transitions depend on the current state and the input.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\nWe will create a dictionary to represent the transition table, where the keys are tuples of the form (current_state, event), and the values are the resulting states. We will then iterate over the input events, updating the current state according to the transition table. If at any point we encounter an event that is not applicable to the current state, we will return \"ERROR\".\n\n```python\ndef tcp_fsm(events):\n    # Define the transition table\n    transitions = {\n        ('CLOSED', 'APP_PASSIVE_OPEN'): 'LISTEN',\n        ('CLOSED', 'APP_ACTIVE_OPEN'): 'SYN_SENT',\n        ('LISTEN', 'RCV_SYN'): 'SYN_RCVD',\n        ('LISTEN', 'APP_SEND'): 'SYN_SENT',\n        ('LISTEN', 'APP_CLOSE'): 'CLOSED',\n        ('SYN_RCVD', 'APP_CLOSE'): 'FIN_WAIT_1',\n        ('SYN_RCVD', 'RCV_ACK'): 'ESTABLISHED',\n        ('SYN_SENT', 'RCV_SYN'): 'SYN_RCVD',\n        ('SYN_SENT', 'RCV_SYN_ACK'): 'ESTABLISHED',\n        ('SYN_SENT', 'APP_CLOSE'): 'CLOSED',\n        ('ESTABLISHED', 'APP_CLOSE'): 'FIN_WAIT_1',\n        ('ESTABLISHED', 'RCV_FIN'): 'CLOSE_WAIT',\n        ('FIN_WAIT_1', 'RCV_FIN'): 'CLOSING',\n        ('FIN_WAIT_1', 'RCV_FIN_ACK'): 'TIME_WAIT',\n        ('FIN_WAIT_1', 'RCV_ACK'): 'FIN_WAIT_2',\n        ('CLOSING', 'RCV_ACK'): 'TIME_WAIT',\n        ('FIN_WAIT_2', 'RCV_FIN'): 'TIME_WAIT',\n        ('TIME_WAIT', 'APP_TIMEOUT'): 'CLOSED',\n        ('CLOSE_WAIT', 'APP_CLOSE'): 'LAST_ACK',\n        ('LAST_ACK', 'RCV_ACK'): 'CLOSED',\n    }\n\n    # Start with the initial state\n    current_state = 'CLOSED'\n\n    # Process each event\n    for event in events:\n        if (current_state, event) in transitions:\n            current_state = transitions[(current_state, event)]\n        else:\n            return \"ERROR\"\n\n    return current_state\n\n# Read the input from standard input\nevents = input().strip().split(', ')\n\n# Call the function and print the result\nprint(tcp_fsm(events))\n```\n\nTo use this code, you would provide the input as a comma-separated list of events in standard input, and the code will print the final state to standard output.

{"name": "1622", "description": "# Ten-Pin Bowling\n\nIn the game of ten-pin bowling, a player rolls a bowling ball down a lane to knock over pins. There are ten pins set at the end of the bowling lane. Each player has 10 frames to roll a bowling ball down a lane and knock over as many pins as possible. The first nine frames are ended after two rolls or when the player knocks down all the pins. The last frame a player will receive an extra roll every time they knock down all ten pins; up to a maximum of three total rolls. \n\n## The Challenge\n\nIn this challenge you will be given a string representing a player's ten frames. It will look something like this: `'X X 9/ 80 X X 90 8/ 7/ 44'` (in Java: `\"X X 9/ 80 X X 90 8/ 7/ 44\"`), where each frame is space-delimited, `'X'` represents strikes, and `'/'` represents spares. Your goal is take in this string of frames into a function called `bowlingScore` and return the players total score.\n\n## Scoring\n\nThe scoring for ten-pin bowling can be difficult to understand, and if you're like most people, easily forgotten if you don't play often. Here is a quick breakdown:\n\n### Frames\n\nIn Ten-Pin Bowling there are ten frames per game. Frames are the players turn to bowl, which can be multiple rolls. The first 9 frames you get 2 rolls maximum to try to get all 10 pins down. **On the 10th or last frame a player will receive an extra roll each time they get all ten pins down to a maximum of three total rolls. Also on the last frame bonuses are not awarded for strikes and spares moving forward.**\n\nIn this challenge, three frames might be represented like this: `54 72 44`. In this case, the player has had three frames. On their first frame they scored 9 points (5 + 4), on their second frame they scored 9 points (7 + 2) and on their third frame they scored 8 points (4 + 4). This is a very simple example of bowling scoring. It gets more complicated when we introduce strikes and spares.\n\n### Strikes \nRepresented in this challenge as `'X'`\n\nA strike is scored when a player knocks all ten pins down in one roll. In the first 9 frames this will conclude the players turn and it will be scored as 10 points plus the points received from the next two rolls. So if a player were to have two frames `X 54`, the total score of those two frames would be 28. The first frame would be worth 19 (10 + 5 + 4) and the second frame would be worth 9 (5 + 4).\n\nA perfect game in bowling is 12 strikes in a row and would be represented like this `'X X X X X X X X X XXX'` (in Java: `\"X X X X X X X X X XXX\"`). This adds up to a total score of 300.\n\n### Spares\nRepresented in this challenge as `'/'`\n\nA spare is scored when a player knocks down all ten pins in two rolls. In the first 9 frames this will be scored as 10 points plus the next roll. So if a player were to have two frames `9/ 54`, the total score of the two frames would be 24. The first frame would be worth 15 (10 + 5) and the second frame would be worth 9 (5 + 4).\n\nFor a more detailed explanation see Wikipedia: \n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten-pin_bowling#Scoring", "difficulty": "interview", "id": 1622, "sample_io": [{"input": "11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11", "output": [20]}, {"input": "X X X X X X X X X XXX", "output": [300]}], "test_list": [{"input": "11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11", "output": [20]}, {"input": "X X X X X X X X X XXX", "output": [300]}, {"input": "00 5/ 4/ 53 33 22 4/ 5/ 45 XXX", "output": [115]}, {"input": "5/ 4/ 3/ 2/ 1/ 0/ X 9/ 4/ 8/8", "output": [150]}, {"input": "5/ 4/ 3/ 2/ 1/ 0/ X 9/ 4/ 7/2", "output": [143]}, {"input": "X X 9/ 80 X X 90 8/ 7/ 44", "output": [171]}, {"input": "6/ 5/ 6/ 2/ 3/ 0/ 1/ 8/ 3/ 6/5", "output": [139]}, {"input": "00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 0/X", "output": [20]}, {"input": "00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 X 0/X", "output": [40]}], "starter_code": "\ndef bowling_score(frames):\n\t", "source_codes": ["\ndef bowlingScore(frames):\n    # Split the frames into a list\n    frames_list = frames.split()\n    score = 0\n    roll_index = 0\n    rolls = []\n\n    # Flatten the frames into individual rolls\n    for frame in frames_list:\n        if frame == 'X':  # Strike\n            rolls.extend(['X', '0'])  # Add a zero roll for easier indexing\n        else:\n            rolls.extend(list(frame))\n\n    # Calculate the score\n    for frame_index in range(10):\n        if rolls[roll_index] == 'X':  # Strike\n            score += 10 + strike_bonus(rolls, roll_index)\n            roll_index += 2\n        elif rolls[roll_index + 1] == '/':  # Spare\n            score += 10 + spare_bonus(rolls, roll_index)\n            roll_index += 2\n        else:  # Normal frame\n            score += sum_pins(rolls[roll_index:roll_index + 2])\n            roll_index += 2\n\n    return score\n\ndef strike_bonus(rolls, index):\n    bonus = sum_pins(rolls[index + 2:index + 4])\n    if rolls[index + 2] == 'X':\n        bonus += sum_pins(rolls[index + 4:index + 5])\n    return bonus\n\ndef spare_bonus(rolls, index):\n    next_roll = rolls[index + 2]\n    return 10 if next_roll == 'X' else int(next_roll)\n\ndef sum_pins(rolls):\n    return sum(10 if roll == 'X' else 10 - int(rolls[i - 1]) if roll == '/' else int(roll) for i, roll in enumerate(rolls))\n\n# Read input from standard input\ninput_frames = input().strip()\n\n# Call the function and print the result to standard output\nprint(bowlingScore(input_frames))\n\n\n"], "responses": ["## Algorithms:\nThe core concept to solve the Ten-Pin Bowling problem is to simulate the scoring rules of the game.

We need to iterate through each frame and process the rolls within them.\n\n2. **Handling Strikes**: When a strike is encountered, we need to add 10 points plus the score of the next two rolls to the total score. We must be careful to handle the tenth frame differently, as it may contain up to three strikes.\n\n3. **Handling Spares**: A spare is when all ten pins are knocked down in two rolls of a frame. The score for a spare is 10 points plus the score of the next single roll.\n\n4. **Handling Normal Rolls**: If neither a strike nor a spare is achieved, the score for the frame is the sum of the pins knocked down in the two rolls.\n\n5. **Calculating the Score**: As we parse the input, we keep a running total of the score, taking into account the bonuses from strikes and spares.\n\n6. **Edge Cases**: We must handle the tenth frame carefully, as it may contain bonus rolls. We also need to ensure that we do not count bonus rolls from the tenth frame into subsequent frames.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Scoring a Bowling Game**: Similar to the Ten-Pin Bowling problem, but with a different input format, such as a list of integers representing the pins knocked down in each roll.\n\n2. **Calculating Cricket Scores**: A problem where you need to calculate the score of a cricket game based on a series of events. This involves different rules but a similar concept of parsing events and updating a score with bonuses.\n\n3. **Scoring a Game of Darts**: In this problem, you would calculate the score of a darts game given a sequence of hits. Each hit could have different values and multipliers, and the scoring rules are different but require similar parsing and accumulation logic.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\nWe will iterate through each frame, keeping track of the score and handling strikes, spares, and normal rolls according to the rules.

Construct a result string with the appropriate prefix based on which string has the maximum frequency for each letter.\n5. Sort the substrings based on their length and lexicographically within the same length.\n6. Join the sorted substrings with a separator.\n\n## Tutorial:\nFrequency counting is often used in problems where you need to track the number of occurrences of elements. In Python, this can be efficiently done using dictionaries or the `collections.Counter` class.\n\nString manipulation involves creating, modifying, and extracting information from strings. Python provides a rich set of methods to handle strings, which makes it a suitable language for string manipulation tasks.\n\nSorting is another common task in programming. Python provides the `sorted()` function, which can sort iterables according to specified rules. You can provide a custom key function to `sorted()` to control the sorting order.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Anagram Check**: Given two strings, write a function to determine if one is an anagram of the other. This problem can be solved by counting the frequency of each character in both strings and comparing the frequency dictionaries.\n\n2. **Most Common Word**: Given a paragraph and a list of banned words, return the most frequent word that is not in the list of banned words. This problem involves frequency counting and filtering based on a condition.\n\n3. **Group Anagrams**: Given an array of strings, group anagrams together. This problem can be solved by mapping sorted strings to their anagrams and then returning the grouped anagrams.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef mix(s1, s2):\n    # Count the frequency of each lowercase letter in both strings\n    counter1 = Counter(filter(str.islower, s1))\n    counter2 = Counter(filter(str.islower, s2))\n    \n    # Construct the result list with the appropriate prefix\n    result = []\n    for letter in set(counter1.keys()).union(counter2.keys()):\n        n1, n2 = counter1[letter], counter2[letter]\n        if max(n1, n2) > 1:\n            if n1 > n2:\n                result.append(f\"1:{letter*n1}\")\n            elif n1 < n2:\n                result.append(f\"2:{letter*n2}\")\n            else:\n                result.append(f\"=:{letter*n1}\")\n    \n    # Sort the result based on length and lexicographically within the same length\n    result.sort(key=lambda x: (-len(x), x))\n    \n    # Join the sorted substrings with a separator\n    return '/'.join(result)\n\n# Read input from standard input\ns1 = input()\ns2 = input()\n\n# Call the function and print the output to standard output\nprint(mix(s1, s2))\n```\n\nThis code defines a function `mix` that takes two strings as input and returns the desired output string.

Moving right from a cell $(x, y)$ takes you to the cell $(x, y + 1)$, while moving down takes you to the cell $(x + 1, y)$.\n\nSome cells of the labyrinth contain rocks. When you move to a cell with rock, the rock is pushed to the next cell in the direction you're moving.

Specifically, we will use a 2D DP table to keep track of the number of ways to reach each cell, considering the constraints imposed by the rocks.\n\n## Tutorial:\nDynamic programming is a method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems. It is applicable to problems exhibiting the properties of overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure. When a problem can be divided into overlapping subproblems, the same subproblems are solved multiple times. DP saves the results of these subproblems to avoid redundant computations.\n\nFor this labyrinth problem, we will create a DP table where `dp[i][j]` represents the number of ways to reach cell `(i, j)`. We will iterate over the labyrinth grid and update the DP table based on the following rules:\n- If a cell contains a rock, we will not update the DP table for that cell since we cannot end a move on a rock.\n- For other cells, the number of ways to reach that cell is the sum of the number of ways to reach the cell to the left of it and the cell above it, as we can only move right or down.\n- When pushing a rock, we need to ensure that the rock does not go outside the labyrinth. This means that if we are at the rightmost column or the bottom row and there is a rock, we cannot move in that direction.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Unique Paths in a Grid**: Given a grid with obstacles, count the number of unique paths from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner. You can only move right or down.\n   Solution: Use DP to keep track of the number of ways to reach each cell, considering cells with obstacles as having 0 ways to reach them.\n\n2. **Minimum Path Sum**: Given a grid filled with non-negative numbers, find a path from the top left to the bottom right which minimizes the sum of all numbers along its path.\n   Solution: Use DP to keep track of the minimum path sum to each cell. The value at each cell is the minimum of the cell to the left and the cell above it, plus the current cell's value.\n\n3. **Longest Increasing Path in a Matrix**: Given an integer matrix, find the length of the longest increasing path. You can move in four directions: left, right, up, and down.\n   Solution: Use DP with memoization to keep track of the longest increasing path starting from each cell. Perform a depth-first search (DFS) from each cell and cache the results to avoid recomputation.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\nWe will create a DP table with dimensions `(n+1) x (m+1)` initialized to 0, with an extra row and column to handle the boundary conditions. We will iterate over the grid, and for each cell that does not contain a rock, we will update the DP table based on the number of ways to reach the cells to the left and above it.

We will stop the loop when the numerator has the required number of digits.\n\nHere is the Python3 code:\n\n```python\nfrom math import factorial\n\ndef expand(x, digits):\n    numerator = 1\n    denominator = 1\n    term = 1  # The first term of the series\n    i = 1  # Start from the x^1/1! term\n    \n    while len(str(numerator)) < digits:\n        term *= x / i\n        numerator += term * denominator\n        denominator *= i\n        i += 1\n        \n        # Reduce the fraction by the gcd of numerator and denominator\n        gcd = find_gcd(numerator, denominator)\n        numerator //= gcd\n        denominator //= gcd\n    \n    return [numerator, denominator]\n\ndef find_gcd(a, b):\n    while b:\n        a, b = b, a % b\n    return a\n\n# Read input from standard input\nx = float(input())\ndigits = int(input())\n\n# Call the function and print the output\nresult = expand(x, digits)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code defines the `expand` function, which calculates the Taylor series for `exp(x)` and stops when the numerator has the required number of digits.

Find the position of the nth digit within that number.\n\nThis problem involves knowledge of arithmetic progressions, string manipulation, and binary search (for optimization).\n\n## Tutorial:\nTo solve this problem, we need to understand that the sequence is made up of concatenated blocks of increasing integers. Each block has a length equal to the number of digits in the integer. For example, the block \"123\" has a length of 3.\n\nFirst, we need to find out which block contains the nth digit. We can do this by summing the lengths of the blocks until the sum is greater than or equal to `n`. However, this approach is not efficient for large values of `n`. Instead, we can use a binary search to find the block that contains the nth digit.\n\nOnce we know which block contains the nth digit, we can calculate the exact number in that block.

The idea is to build up a table `dp` where each entry `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to make change for the amount `i` using the given denominations. This is a classic example of a problem that can be solved using the bottom-up approach to dynamic programming.\n\n## Tutorial:\nDynamic programming is a method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems. It is applicable to problems exhibiting the properties of overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure. When solving a problem using dynamic programming, you solve each subproblem only once and store the results in a table to avoid the work of recomputing the answer every time the same subproblem occurs.\n\nFor the coin change problem, the dynamic programming solution involves creating a table `dp` of size `amount+1` and initializing it with 0's. The base case is `dp[0] = 1`, since there is exactly one way to make change for zero amount (using no coins). For each coin denomination, you iterate over the amounts from the coin's value up to the target amount. For each amount `x`, you update `dp[x]` by adding the number of ways to make change for `x - coin_value`.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Minimum Number of Coins**: Given an amount and an array of coin denominations, find the minimum number of coins that you need to make up that amount. The solution involves a similar dynamic programming approach where you keep track of the minimum number of coins needed for each amount up to the target.\n\n2. **Maximum Ways to Make Change**: Given an amount and an array of coin denominations, find the maximum number of ways you can make change if each coin denomination has a limited quantity. This problem extends the coin change problem by adding a constraint on the number of coins available.\n\n3. **Subset Sum Problem**: Given a set of non-negative integers and a value sum, determine if there is a subset of the given set with a sum equal to the given sum. This problem is similar in that it also uses dynamic programming to build up a solution based on smaller subproblems.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\nThe function `count_change` initializes a list `dp` of size `amount+1` with all zeros except for `dp[0]` which is set to 1. It then iterates over each coin denomination and updates the `dp` array for each amount that can be reached by adding the current coin denomination. The final result is the value of `dp[amount]`, which represents the number of ways to make change for the given amount.\n\n```python\ndef count_change(amount, coins):\n    dp = [0] * (amount + 1)\n    dp[0] = 1\n    \n    for coin in coins:\n        for x in range(coin, amount + 1):\n            dp[x] += dp[x - coin]\n    \n    return dp[amount]\n\n# Taking input and calling the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    amount = int(input())\n    coins = list(map(int, input().strip('[]').split(',')))\n    print(count_change(amount, coins))\n```\n\nTo use the above code, you would run the script and input the amount and coin denominations in the specified format when prompted.

The problem is to find the largest number that cannot be formed by the sum of multiples of given numbers. The algorithm involves understanding the properties of the greatest common divisor (GCD) and the concept of linear combinations.\n\n## Tutorial:\nThe Frobenius Coin Problem is a classic problem in number theory that asks for the largest monetary amount that cannot be obtained using only coins of specified denominations. The problem is named after the mathematician Ferdinand Frobenius.\n\nFor two coin denominations, the solution to the problem is given by the formula `(a * b) - a - b`, where `a` and `b` are the coin denominations and `gcd(a, b) = 1` (they are coprime). For more than two coin denominations, the problem becomes NP-hard, and there is no known formula to directly calculate the answer.\n\nHowever, for the case where we have more than two numbers, we can use a greedy algorithm to find the largest number that cannot be formed by the sum of multiples of given numbers. The algorithm works as follows:\n\n1. Sort the list of numbers.\n2. Start with a variable `max_unreachable` set to 0.\n3. Iterate through the sorted list of numbers:\n   - If the current number is greater than `max_unreachable + 1`, then `max_unreachable + 1` is the largest number that cannot be formed, and we can stop the algorithm.\n   - Otherwise, update `max_unreachable` to include the current number by adding it to `max_unreachable`.\n4. If the loop completes without finding such a number, return -1, indicating that there is no such largest number.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Coin Change Problem**: Given an unlimited supply of coins of given denominations, find the total number of distinct ways to get a desired change.\n   - Solution: This problem can be solved using dynamic programming by building a table that represents the number of ways to get each amount of change from 0 up to the desired amount.\n\n2. **Subset Sum Problem**: Given a set of non-negative integers, and a value sum, determine if there is a subset of the given set with sum equal to the given sum.\n   - Solution: This problem can also be approached with dynamic programming by creating a 2D array that stores true or false values indicating whether a subset with a given sum can be formed from the first `i` elements.\n\n3. **Minimum Number of Coins**: Given a value V, if we want to make change for V cents, and we have an infinite supply of each of C = { C1, C2, .. , Cm} valued coins, what is the minimum number of coins to make the change?\n   - Solution: This is a variation of the coin change problem and can be solved using dynamic programming or a greedy approach if the coin denominations follow a specific pattern.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n```python\ndef find_largest_unreachable_number(coins):\n    coins.sort()\n    max_unreachable = 0\n    for coin in coins:\n        if coin > max_unreachable + 1:\n            return max_unreachable + 1\n        max_unreachable += coin\n    return -1\n\n# Taking input from standard input\ncoins = list(map(int, input().strip().split(',')))\n\n# Calling the function and printing the result\nprint(find_largest_unreachable_number(coins))\n```\n\nTo use the above code, you would input the list of numbers separated by commas (e.g., \"7,11\") and the code will output the largest number that cannot be represented as the sum of these numbers (e.g., \"59\")."], "prompt_tokens": [629], "completion_tokens": [791], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": false, "language": "Python3", "task_id": 1630}

Then, for each number `i` from 1 to `n`, and for each possible summand `j` from 1 to `i`, we update the table by adding the number of partitions of `i - j` to `dp[i]`.\n\nThe key insight is that the number of partitions of `i` that include `j` as a summand is the same as the number of partitions of `i - j`, since we can simply add `j` to each of those partitions to get a partition of `i`.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Coin Change Problem**: Given an unlimited supply of coins of given denominations, find the number of ways to make a change of a given amount of money.\n   - Solution: This problem can be solved using a similar dynamic programming approach, where we build a table to store the number of ways to make each amount using the given denominations.\n   - Python3 code:\n   ```python\n   def coin_change(coins, amount):\n       dp = [0] * (amount + 1)\n       dp[0] = 1\n       for coin in coins:\n           for x in range(coin, amount + 1):\n               dp[x] += dp[x - coin]\n       return dp[amount]\n   ```\n\n2. **Subset Sum Problem**: Given a set of non-negative integers, and a value sum, determine if there is a subset of the given set with sum equal to the given sum.\n   - Solution: Use dynamic programming to create a table where each entry `dp[i][j]` is true if there is a subset of the first `i` numbers that adds up to `j`.\n   - Python3 code:\n   ```python\n   def subset_sum(nums, sum):\n       dp = [[False] * (sum + 1) for _ in range(len(nums) + 1)]\n       for i in range(len(nums) + 1):\n           dp[i][0] = True\n       for i in range(1, len(nums) + 1):\n           for j in range(1, sum + 1):\n               if j >= nums[i-1]:\n                   dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] or dp[i-1][j-nums[i-1]]\n               else:\n                   dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j]\n       return dp[len(nums)][sum]\n   ```\n\n3. **Fibonacci Sequence**: Find the `n`th Fibonacci number.\n   - Solution: Use dynamic programming to build a table of Fibonacci numbers up to `n`.\n   - Python3 code:\n   ```python\n   def fibonacci(n):\n       if n <= 1:\n           return n\n       fib = [0] * (n+1)\n       fib[1] = 1\n       for i in range(2, n+1):\n           fib[i] = fib[i-1] + fib[i-2]\n       return fib[n]\n   ```\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n- Explanation of the solution:\n  We will use dynamic programming to solve the partition problem. We will create a list `dp` where `dp[i]` will store the number of partitions of the number `i`. We will iterate over each number from 1 to `n` and for each number, we will iterate over the possible summands to update the `dp` list.\n\n- Python3 code to solve the problem:\n```python\ndef exp_sum(n):\n    dp = [0] * (n + 1)\n    dp[0] = 1  # There is one way to partition 0\n\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        for j in range(i, n + 1):\n            dp[j] += dp[j - i]\n\n    return dp[n]\n\n# Read input from standard input and print the result to standard output\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    n = int(input())\n    print(exp_sum(n))\n```\n\nThis code will correctly calculate the number of partitions for a given number `n` using dynamic programming."], "prompt_tokens": [616], "completion_tokens": [1019], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": false, "language": "Python3", "task_id": 1659}

We will need to parse the polynomial string, identify each term, differentiate each term, and then evaluate the derivative at the given point `x`.\n\n## Tutorial:\nDifferentiation is a fundamental concept in calculus, used to find the rate at which a function is changing at any given point. For polynomials, the differentiation process is straightforward thanks to the power rule. The power rule states that if you have a term in the form of `ax^n`, where `a` is a constant and `n` is a positive integer, the derivative of that term with respect to `x` is `n*ax^(n-1)`.\n\nTo differentiate a polynomial string in Python, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Parse the polynomial string into individual terms.\n2. For each term, identify the coefficient and the exponent.\n3. Apply the power rule to differentiate each term.\n4. Evaluate the differentiated term at the given value of `x`.\n5. Sum the results of all differentiated terms to get the final answer.\n\nWhen parsing the polynomial string, you can split the string by the '+' and '-' signs, taking care to keep the sign with the term if it's a subtraction. Then, for each term, you can further split or use regular expressions to extract the coefficient and the exponent.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Finding the Derivative of a Function**: Given a function as a string, find its derivative. This is a direct application of the differentiation rules.\n2. **Tangent Line to a Polynomial**: Given a polynomial and a point, find the equation of the tangent line at that point. This involves finding the derivative and then using the point-slope form of a line.\n3. **Maxima and Minima of a Polynomial**: Given a polynomial, find its local maxima and minima. This involves finding the derivative, setting it to zero, and solving for `x` to find critical points.\n\nFor each of these problems, the solution involves parsing the function, differentiating it, and then possibly doing further calculations like evaluating the derivative or solving equations.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef differentiate(polynomial, x):\n    # Split the polynomial into terms\n    terms = re.findall(r'[+-]?\\s*\\d*x\\^?\\d*', polynomial.replace(' ', ''))\n    derivative = 0\n    \n    for term in terms:\n        # Extract the coefficient and exponent\n        coefficient, exponent = 1, 0\n        if 'x' in term:\n            if '^' in term:\n                coefficient, exponent = term.split('x^')\n                exponent = int(exponent)\n            else:\n                coefficient = term.split('x')[0]\n            coefficient = int(coefficient) if coefficient not in ['', '+', '-'] else int(coefficient + '1')\n        else:\n            continue  # It's a constant term, derivative is 0\n        \n        # Apply the power rule\n        if exponent == 0:\n            continue  # The term is a constant, derivative is 0\n        elif exponent == 1:\n            derivative += coefficient\n        else:\n            derivative += coefficient * exponent * (x ** (exponent - 1))\n    \n    return derivative\n\n# Read input from standard input\npolynomial = input().strip()\nx = int(input().strip())\n\n# Call the function and print the result to standard output\nprint(differentiate(polynomial, x))\n```\n\nThis code defines a function `differentiate` that takes a polynomial as a string and a point `x` as an integer.

This algorithm finds the longest palindromic substring in linear time complexity, O(N).\n\n## Tutorial:\nManacher's Algorithm is a clever way to transform the input string in such a way that it eliminates the need to handle even and odd length palindromes separately. It does this by inserting a unique character (often `#`) between each character of the string (including the ends). This turns every palindrome into an odd-length palindrome centered at a unique character.\n\nHere's a step-by-step explanation of Manacher's Algorithm:\n1. Transform the input string by inserting a unique character between each character and at the ends. For example, \"abba\" becomes \"#a#b#b#a#\".\n2. Create an array `P` to store the length of the palindrome radius centered at each character in the transformed string.\n3. Initialize variables to track the center and right boundary of the current longest palindrome.\n4. Iterate through the transformed string. For each character, determine if it is within the bounds of the current longest palindrome. If it is, use the previously computed palindrome lengths to set the initial value of `P[i]`.\n5. Expand around the center to find the actual palindrome length for `P[i]`.\n6. Update the center and right boundary if the palindrome found extends beyond the current right boundary.\n7. Keep track of the maximum palindrome length and its center position.\n8. After processing, find the longest palindrome in the original string using the information stored in `P`.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Palindrome Partitioning II**: Given a string, partition it such that every substring of the partition is a palindrome. Return the minimum cuts needed for a palindrome partitioning of the string. The solution involves first using Manacher's Algorithm to find all palindromic substrings and then dynamic programming to find the minimum cuts.\n\n2. **Shortest Palindrome**: You are given a string `s`. You can convert `s` to a palindrome by adding characters in front of it. Find and return the shortest palindrome you can find by performing this transformation. Manacher's Algorithm can be used to find the longest palindromic substring starting at the beginning of the string, and then the remaining characters are added to the front to form the shortest palindrome.\n\n3. **Longest Palindromic Subsequence**: This is a variation where instead of a substring, we are interested in a subsequence. A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. This problem is typically solved using dynamic programming, but it's relevant to understand the difference between subsequence and substring in the context of palindromes.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n```python\ndef longest_palindromic_substring(s):\n    # Transform the string and initialize variables\n    T = '#'.join(f'^{s}$')\n    n = len(T)\n    P = [0] * n\n    C = R = max_center = 0\n\n    for i in range(1, n - 1):\n        # Mirror of i with respect to C\n        mirr = 2 * C - i\n\n        # Update the minimum length of palindrome radius\n        if i < R:\n            P[i] = min(R - i, P[mirr])\n\n        # Expand around the center i\n        while T[i + (1 + P[i])] == T[i - (1 + P[i])]:\n            P[i] += 1\n\n        # Update the center and right boundary\n        if i + P[i] > R:\n            C, R = i, i + P[i]\n\n        # Update the maximum palindrome center\n        if P[i] > P[max_center]:\n            max_center = i\n\n    # Find the longest palindrome in the original string\n    start = (max_center - P[max_center]) // 2\n    return s[start:start + P[max_center]]\n\n# Read input, call the function and print the output\ninput_string = input().strip()\nprint(longest_palindromic_substring(input_string))\n```\n\nThis code reads a string from standard input, processes it using Manacher's Algorithm to find the longest palindromic substring, and prints the result to standard output."], "prompt_tokens": [682], "completion_tokens": [913], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": false, "language": "Python3", "task_id": 1638}

A cycle in a permutation is a subset of elements that are moved to each other's positions when the permutation is applied. In this problem, each cycle can be sorted independently to achieve the overall sorted sequence.\n\n## Tutorial:\nTo solve this problem, we need to:\n\n1. Understand that the given sequence can be viewed as a permutation of the numbers from 1 to n, where each number is mapped to its position in the sorted sequence.\n2. Identify cycles in this permutation. A cycle is a sequence of indices such that the elements at these indices form a closed chain in the permutation.\n3. Each cycle can be sorted independently without affecting the other elements.\n4. The maximum number of subsequences we can split the original sequence into is equal to the number of cycles in the permutation.\n\nTo find the cycles, we can use a graph approach where each element points to its position in the sorted array. Then, we perform a depth-first search (DFS) to find all the cycles. Each visited node is marked to avoid repetition.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Finding Cycles in a Permutation**: Given a permutation of numbers, find all the cycles within it. The solution involves iterating through the permutation, using a visited array to keep track of which elements have been included in a cycle, and performing a DFS to find and output each cycle.\n\n2. **Minimum Swaps to Sort**: Given an array of integers, find the minimum number of swaps required to sort the array. This problem is similar because it also involves finding cycles in the permutation represented by the array, where the number of swaps needed is the sum of the lengths of the cycles minus the number of cycles.\n\n3. **Detecting Cycles in a Directed Graph**: Given a directed graph, determine if it contains a cycle. This problem is related because finding cycles in a permutation can be seen as a special case of cycle detection in a directed graph, where each element points to exactly one other element.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\n- We will first create a mapping from each element to its index in the sorted array.\n- We will then iterate through the array, and for each unvisited element, we will perform a DFS to find the cycle it belongs to.\n- We will output the number of cycles and the indices of elements in each cycle.\n\n```python\ndef find_cycles(sequence):\n    sorted_indices = sorted(range(len(sequence)), key=lambda x: sequence[x])\n    visited = [False] * len(sequence)\n    cycles = []\n\n    for i in range(len(sequence)):\n        if not visited[i]:\n            cycle = []\n            while not visited[i]:\n                visited[i] = True\n                cycle.append(i + 1)  # +1 for 1-based index\n                i = sorted_indices[i]\n            cycles.append(cycle)\n    return cycles\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    sequence = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))\n    cycles = find_cycles(sequence)\n    print(len(cycles))\n    for cycle in cycles:\n        print(len(cycle), *cycle)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nThis code will read the input, find the cycles, and then print the maximum number of subsequences along with their descriptions as required."], "prompt_tokens": [773], "completion_tokens": [695], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": true, "language": "Python3", "task_id": 2096}

A winning position is one where the current player has a strategy that guarantees a win regardless of the opponent's moves, while a losing position is one where the current player cannot avoid defeat if the opponent plays optimally.\n\nThe key algorithmic idea here is to analyze the game state to determine if the current player is in a winning or losing position. This involves considering the number of stones in each pile and the constraints on choosing piles.\n\n## Tutorial:\nIn game theory, particularly in combinatorial games, the analysis often revolves around the concept of \"Nim-sum\" and \"Grundy numbers\" for impartial games. However, this problem has an additional constraint that makes it different from a standard Nim game: a player cannot choose the same pile as the previous turn.\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to consider the following:\n1. If there is only one pile with more than one stone, the first player can always win by taking a stone from that pile. The second player will have no legal moves on the next turn.\n2. If all piles have exactly one stone, the player who starts on an odd number of total stones will win, as they will take the last stone.\n3. If there are multiple piles with more than one stone, we need to consider the possibility of leaving the opponent with no legal moves by carefully choosing which pile to take from.\n\nThe strategy is to simulate the game considering the constraints and determine the winner.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Nim Game**: Given several piles of stones, two players take turns removing any number of stones from one pile. The player to remove the last stone wins. The solution involves computing the Nim-sum (XOR of the pile sizes) and determining if it is non-zero (winning position for the first player) or zero (losing position for the first player).\n\n2. **Mis\u00e8re Nim**: Similar to Nim, but the player to remove the last stone loses. The strategy changes when there is only one pile with more than one stone left.\n\n3. **Sprague-Grundy Theorem**: For more complex impartial games, the Sprague-Grundy theorem can be used to assign a \"Grundy number\" to each position, which is used to determine the winning strategy by computing the Nim-sum of these numbers.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\nThe solution involves iterating over each game configuration and applying the strategy mentioned above.

The minimum number of languages to be learned is equal to the number of such groups minus one, as each group can learn one common language to communicate with other groups.\n\n## Tutorial:\nThe Union-Find algorithm is a classic data structure that keeps track of elements which are split into one or more disjoint sets. Its primary use is to determine whether two elements are in the same set or to merge two sets. The algorithm consists of two main operations:\n\n1. **Find**: Determine which subset a particular element is in. This can be used for determining if two elements are in the same subset.\n2. **Union**: Join two subsets into a single subset.\n\nThe Union-Find algorithm is often implemented with two heuristics to improve its runtime complexity:\n\n- **Path Compression**: During the find operation, make each looked-up element point directly to the representative (root) of its set, flattening the structure of the tree and speeding up future find operations.\n- **Union by Rank**: Always attach the smaller tree to the root of the larger tree during union operations. This keeps the tree shallow and the operations fast.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Number of Islands (LeetCode 200)**: Given a 2D grid map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), count the number of islands. An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.\n   - Solution: Use Union-Find to merge adjacent lands into a single island and count the number of distinct sets.\n\n2. **Friend Circles (LeetCode 547)**: There are N students in a class. The friendship between students is represented in an N x N matrix, where the ith row and jth column of the matrix indicate whether student i and student j are direct friends. Determine the number of friend circles in the class.\n   - Solution: Use Union-Find to merge students who are direct friends, and count the number of distinct sets representing friend circles.\n\n3. **Connecting Cities With Minimum Cost (LeetCode 1135)**: There are N cities numbered from 1 to N. You are given connections, where each connections[i] = [city1, city2, cost] represents the cost to connect city1 and city2 together. Return the minimum cost so that for every pair of cities, there exists a path of connections (possibly of length 1) that connects those two cities together.

Since Jinotega always flies back home after each competition, we can count the number of flights from and to the home airport. If the counts are equal, Jinotega is at home; otherwise, they are at a contest.\n\n## Tutorial:\nThe counting algorithm is straightforward. You iterate through each flight and increment the count for departures and arrivals for the home airport. If the counts are equal, it means for every departure there is a corresponding arrival, indicating that Jinotega has returned home after each trip. If the counts are not equal, it means there is an extra departure without a corresponding arrival, indicating that Jinotega is currently at a contest.\n\nHere's a step-by-step approach:\n1. Read the number of flights and the home airport code.\n2. Initialize two counters, one for departures from home and one for arrivals to home.\n3. Iterate through each flight entry.\n4. If the departure airport is the home airport, increment the departure counter.\n5. If the arrival airport is the home airport, increment the arrival counter.\n6. After processing all flights, compare the counters.\n7. If the counters are equal, print \"home\"; otherwise, print \"contest\".\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Balanced Parentheses**: Given a string of parentheses, check if the string is balanced. A string is balanced if every opening parenthesis has a corresponding closing parenthesis. The solution involves iterating through the string and using a counter to keep track of the balance. If the counter is zero at the end, the string is balanced.\n\n2. **Stock Span Problem**: Given an array of daily stock prices, calculate the span of the stock's price for all days. The span is the number of consecutive days before the current day where the stock price was less than or equal to the current day's price. The solution involves using a stack to keep track of the indices of the days and iterating through the array to calculate the spans.\n\n3. **Finding the Missing Number**: Given an array containing n distinct numbers taken from 0, 1, 2, ..., n, find the one that is missing from the array.

We can use an array to represent the wealth of each citizen and update it according to the events. For the payouts, we need to efficiently update multiple elements of the array to a new value, which can be done using a lazy propagation technique to avoid updating each element individually.\n\n## Tutorial:\nLazy propagation is a technique used in segment trees or similar data structures to defer updates to later, instead of updating all elements immediately. This is particularly useful when multiple updates affect a large portion of the array. Instead of updating every element, we mark a segment as \"to be updated\" and only apply the update when necessary (e.g., when accessing an element in the segment).\n\nIn this problem, we can use a simpler form of lazy propagation. We keep track of the last payout value and only apply it when we know the exact wealth of a citizen (e.g., when a receipt event occurs). This way, we avoid iterating over all citizens during a payout event.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Range Update and Query in Array**: Given an array and a set of range update queries (incrementing all elements within a range by a certain value), followed by range sum queries, efficiently compute the sum of elements within a given range after all updates.\n\n2. **Applying Threshold to Array Elements**: Given an array and a threshold value, increment all elements of the array that are below the threshold to the threshold value, and then perform queries to find the value of a specific element.\n\n3. **Minimum Range Queries**: Given an array and a set of range update queries (setting all elements within a range to a certain value), followed by queries to find the minimum value within a given range.\n\nFor each of these problems, a lazy propagation technique can be used to efficiently apply updates and answer queries without updating each element individually.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\n- We will maintain an array `balances` to store the current wealth of each citizen.\n- We will also keep track of the last payout value `last_payout`.\n- For each event, if it's a receipt (event type 1), we update the wealth of the specific citizen and check if the last payout should be applied to them.\n- If it's a payout (event type 2), we update the `last_payout` value.\n- After processing all events, we iterate through the `balances` array and apply the last payout if necessary.\n\n```python\nn = int(input())\nbalances = list(map(int, input().split()))\nq = int(input())\n\nlast_payout = 0\n\nfor _ in range(q):\n    event = list(map(int, input().split()))\n    if event[0] == 1:\n        # Receipt event\n        p, x = event[1]-1, event[2]\n        balances[p] = max(x, last_payout)\n    elif event[0] == 2:\n        # Payout event\n        x = event[1]\n        last_payout = max(last_payout, x)\n\n# Apply the last payout to all citizens if necessary\nfor i in range(n):\n    balances[i] = max(balances[i], last_payout)\n\n# Print the final balances\nprint(' '.join(map(str, balances)))\n```\n\nThis code will correctly simulate the events and output the final balances of all citizens."], "prompt_tokens": [865], "completion_tokens": [707], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": false, "language": "Python3", "task_id": 2218}

The algorithm involves iterating through the bits of the given binary numbers and identifying the pairs of positions where a swap would change the bitwise OR result.\n\n## Tutorial:\nThe bitwise OR operation takes two binary numbers and performs the OR operation on each pair of corresponding bits. The OR operation is defined as follows:\n- 0 OR 0 = 0\n- 0 OR 1 = 1\n- 1 OR 0 = 1\n- 1 OR 1 = 1\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to find pairs of bits in `a` that can be swapped to change the bitwise OR result. This can only happen if one of the bits in the pair is 0 in `a` and the corresponding bit in `b` is also 0, and the other bit in the pair is 1 in `a`. Swapping these bits will change the 0 to 1 in the position where `b` has a 0, thus changing the OR result.\n\nThe steps to solve the problem are:\n1. Count the number of 0s in `a` that have corresponding 0s in `b`. Let's call this count `zero_count`.\n2. Count the number of 1s in `a`. Let's call this count `one_count`.\n3. The number of ways to swap is the product of `zero_count` and `one_count` because each 0 with a corresponding 0 in `b` can be swapped with any 1 in `a`.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Hamming Distance**: Given two binary numbers, find the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different. The solution involves XORing the two numbers and counting the number of 1s in the result.\n\n2. **Maximum XOR of Two Numbers in an Array**: Given an array of integers, find the maximum XOR of any two elements. The solution involves using a trie to efficiently compare the bits of the numbers.\n\n3. **Single Number**: Given a non-empty array of integers where every element appears twice except for one, find that single one. The solution is to XOR all the numbers, and the result will be the single number since XORing a number with itself cancels out to 0.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n```python\ndef count_swaps_to_change_or(n, a, b):\n    zero_count = 0  # Count of 0s in 'a' that have corresponding 0s in 'b'\n    one_count = 0   # Count of 1s in 'a'\n    \n    # Iterate through each bit position\n    for i in range(n):\n        if a[i] == '0' and b[i] == '0':\n            zero_count += 1\n        if a[i] == '1':\n            one_count += 1\n    \n    # The number of swaps is the product of zero_count and one_count\n    return zero_count * one_count\n\n# Read input from standard input\nn = int(input().strip())\na = input().strip()\nb = input().strip()\n\n# Call the function and print the result to standard output\nprint(count_swaps_to_change_or(n, a, b))\n```\n\nThis code reads the input for `n`, `a`, and `b`, calls the `count_swaps_to_change_or` function with these inputs, and prints the result.

Instead, we can use a more efficient approach by tracking the minimum number of operations required to destroy each tower.\n\nHere's a step-by-step approach to solve the problem:\n1.

The board is represented by a matrix where each cell is an integer representing a different type of candy. A move in Candy Crush consists of choosing a cell and eliminating all candies of the same type that form a horizontal or vertical line with the chosen candy.\n   - Solution: Simulate the game by iteratively scanning the board for lines of matching candies and marking them for elimination.

{"name": "2064", "description": "3R2 as DJ Mashiro - Happiness Breeze Ice - DJ Mashiro is dead or alive\n\nNEKO#\u03a6\u03c9\u03a6 has just got a new maze game on her PC!\n\nThe game's main puzzle is a maze, in the forms of a $2 \\times n$ rectangle grid. NEKO's task is to lead a Nekomimi girl from cell $(1, 1)$ to the gate at $(2, n)$ and escape the maze. The girl can only move between cells sharing a common side.\n\nHowever, at some moments during the game, some cells may change their state: either from normal ground to lava (which forbids movement into that cell), or vice versa (which makes that cell passable again). Initially all cells are of the ground type.\n\nAfter hours of streaming, NEKO finally figured out there are only $q$ such moments: the $i$-th moment toggles the state of cell $(r_i, c_i)$ (either from ground to lava or vice versa).\n\nKnowing this, NEKO wonders, after each of the $q$ moments, whether it is still possible to move from cell $(1, 1)$ to cell $(2, n)$ without going through any lava cells.\n\nAlthough NEKO is a great streamer and gamer, she still can't get through quizzes and problems requiring large amount of Brain Power. Can you help her?\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains integers $n$, $q$ ($2 \\le n \\le 10^5$, $1 \\le q \\le 10^5$).\n\nThe $i$-th of $q$ following lines contains two integers $r_i$, $c_i$ ($1 \\le r_i \\le 2$, $1 \\le c_i \\le n$), denoting the coordinates of the cell to be flipped at the $i$-th moment.\n\nIt is guaranteed that cells $(1, 1)$ and $(2, n)$ never appear in the query list.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each moment, if it is possible to travel from cell $(1, 1)$ to cell $(2, n)$, print \"Yes\", otherwise print \"No\". There should be exactly $q$ answers, one after every update.\n\nYou can print the words in any case (either lowercase, uppercase or mixed).\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n5 5\n2 3\n1 4\n2 4\n2 3\n1 4\n\nOutput\nYes\nNo\nNo\nNo\nYes\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nWe'll crack down the example test here:  After the first query, the girl still able to reach the goal. One of the shortest path ways should be: $(1,1) \\to (1,2) \\to (1,3) \\to (1,4) \\to (1,5) \\to (2,5)$.  After the second query, it's impossible to move to the goal, since the farthest cell she could reach is $(1, 3)$.  After the fourth query, the $(2, 3)$ is not blocked, but now all the $4$-th column is blocked, so she still can't reach the goal.  After the fifth query, the column barrier has been lifted, thus she can go to the final goal again.", "difficulty": "competition", "id": 2064, "sample_io": [{"input": "5 5\n2 3\n1 4\n2 4\n2 3\n1 4\n",

Specifically, we need to maintain the connectivity status of the maze after each update and determine if there is a path from the start to the end. A simple approach to this problem is to use a disjoint-set data structure (also known as a union-find data structure) to keep track of connected components. However, since the maze is a $2 \\times n$ grid, we can use a more straightforward method by keeping track of the blocked cells in each column and checking if there is a way around them.\n\n## Tutorial:\nGraph traversal algorithms like Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS) are commonly used to explore nodes and edges of a graph. They can be used to determine connectivity between nodes, find shortest paths, or simply traverse all reachable parts of the graph.\n\nThe disjoint-set data structure is a data structure that keeps track of a set of elements partitioned into a number of disjoint (non-overlapping) subsets. It supports two useful operations:\n- **Find**: Determine which subset a particular element is in. This can be used for determining if two elements are in the same subset.\n- **Union**: Join two subsets into a single subset.\n\nIn the context of this problem, we can use a simpler approach by keeping track of the state of each cell and checking if there is a path that avoids the lava cells. Since the maze is only two rows high, we only need to check if there is a blockage in both rows of the same column.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Number of Islands (LeetCode 200)**: Given a 2D grid map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), count the number of islands. An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.\n   - Solution: Use DFS or BFS to traverse the grid. When a land cell is found, perform a traversal to mark all connected land cells, effectively \"sinking\" the island. Increment the island count each time a new island is found.\n\n2. **Friend Circles (LeetCode 547)**: There are N students in a class. Some of them are friends, while some are not. Their friendship is transitive in nature. For example, if A is a direct friend of B, and B is a direct friend of C, then A is an indirect friend of C. Given a N*N matrix M representing the friend relationships between students in the class. If M[i][j] = 1, then the ith and jth students are direct friends with each other, otherwise not. You need to output the total number of friend circles among all the students.\n   - Solution: Use the disjoint-set data structure to merge friend circles. Initially, each student is in their own set. Iterate through the matrix, and for each pair of friends, perform a union operation. The number of friend circles is the number of unique sets at the end.\n\n3. **Connecting Cities With Minimum Cost (LeetCode 1135)**: There are N cities numbered from 1 to N. You are given connections, where each connections[i] = [city1, city2, cost] represents the cost to connect city1 and city2 together. (A connection is bidirectional: connecting city1 and city2 is the same as connecting city2 and city1.) Return the minimum cost so that for every pair of cities, there exists a path of connections (possibly of length 1) that connects those two cities together. The cost is the sum of the connection costs used. If the task is impossible, return -1.\n   - Solution: Use Kruskal's algorithm to find the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of the graph. Sort the connections by cost, and use a disjoint-set data structure to avoid cycles while adding the cheapest edges to the MST.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\nWe will keep track of the state of each cell in the maze. For each query, we will toggle the state of the specified cell. After each toggle, we will check if there is a blockage in both rows of the same column. If there is, then it is impossible to reach the end; otherwise, it is possible.\n\n```python\ndef is_path_possible(blocked_cells, n):\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        if blocked_cells[0][i] and blocked_cells[1][i]:\n            return False\n    return True\n\ndef main():\n    n, q = map(int, input().split())\n    blocked_cells = [[False] * n for _ in range(2)]\n    \n    for _ in range(q):\n        r, c = map(int, input().split())\n        r -= 1  # Adjusting index to be 0-based\n        c -= 1  # Adjusting index to be 0-based\n        \n        # Toggle the state of the cell\n        blocked_cells[r][c] = not blocked_cells[r][c]\n        \n        # Check if there is still a path from (1, 1) to (2, n)\n        if is_path_possible(blocked_cells, n):\n            print(\"Yes\")\n        else:\n            print(\"No\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nThis code reads the input, processes each query, and outputs whether a path is possible after each toggle.

The bitwise OR operation is idempotent, which means applying it multiple times between the same numbers will not change the result. This property can be used to reduce the number of computations needed to find all distinct values of the function f(l, r).\n\n## Tutorial:\nThe bitwise OR operation takes two bit patterns of equal length and performs the logical inclusive OR operation on each pair of corresponding bits. The result in each position is 1 if the first bit is 1 or the second bit is 1 or both bits are 1; otherwise, the result is 0.\n\nFor example:\n```\n  0101 (decimal 5)\n| 0011 (decimal 3)\n  ----\n  0111 (decimal 7)\n```\n\nTo solve problems involving the bitwise OR operation, one can use the following strategies:\n1. **Precomputation**: Compute the results of the bitwise OR operation for certain ranges in advance to avoid redundant calculations.\n2. **Use of Sets or Hashing**: To keep track of distinct values, use a set or a hash table, which allows for constant-time checks for duplicates.\n3. **Optimization**: Recognize patterns or properties that can reduce the number of operations, such as the idempotent nature of the bitwise OR.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Maximum OR Sum of Sub-arrays**: Given an array, find the maximum OR sum of all its sub-arrays.

In the context of this problem, the locally optimal choice is to find the time slot with the maximum number of classes and ensure we have enough rooms to accommodate those classes.\n\nTo implement this, we can follow these steps:\n1.

The problem requires careful handling of the string operations to avoid time complexity issues that could arise from directly manipulating strings. The key algorithms and techniques involved are:\n\n1. Simulation of the described process.\n2. String slicing and concatenation.\n3. Modular arithmetic to handle large numbers.\n4. Optimization to avoid unnecessary recomputation or string copying.\n\n## Tutorial:\nSimulation is a straightforward approach where you implement the process as described in the problem statement step by step. However, simulating the process directly on strings can be inefficient due to the potential for the string to grow exponentially. Instead, we can simulate the process on the lengths of the strings, which allows us to avoid the overhead of string operations.\n\nString slicing and concatenation are basic operations in Python. Slicing is used to obtain a substring, and concatenation is used to join strings together. In Python, slicing a string `s` from index `i` to `j` is done by `s[i:j]`, and concatenation of strings `a` and `b` is done by `a + b`.\n\nModular arithmetic is used when dealing with large numbers to prevent integer overflow and to keep the numbers within a manageable range. In Python, the modulo operation is performed using the `%` operator.\n\nOptimization is crucial in competitive programming. In this problem, we can optimize by realizing that once the length of the string `s` exceeds `x`, we no longer need to simulate the process for the entire string. We only need to keep track of the length of `s` and update it according to the rules.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **String Transformation**: Given a string and a set of rules to transform it, determine the final string after applying the rules a certain number of times.\n   Solution: Simulate the transformation process, applying each rule to the string. Use string slicing and concatenation to perform the transformations.\n\n2. **DNA Sequence**: A DNA sequence is represented by a string composed of characters 'A', 'T', 'C', and 'G'. A series of operations are performed on the sequence, such as reversing a segment, replacing a segment, or appending a segment. Determine the final sequence.\n   Solution: Use string slicing and concatenation to simulate the operations. Keep track of the changes to avoid unnecessary recomputation.\n\n3. **Adding Machine**: A machine takes a string of digits and performs operations such as adding a digit to the end, removing a digit, or duplicating a segment. Determine the final string after a series of operations.\n   Solution: Simulate the operations, using string manipulation techniques and modular arithmetic if the problem involves large numbers.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\nWe will simulate the process described in the problem statement, but instead of manipulating the string directly, we will keep track of the length of `s` and update it according to the rules. We will use modular arithmetic to handle large numbers.\n\n```python\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\ndef calculate_length(x, s):\n    s_len = len(s)\n    i = 0\n    while i < x:\n        # Convert the current character to an integer and decrement by 1\n        # because the string is 0-indexed but the characters represent 1-indexed counts.\n        repeat_count = int(s[i]) - 1\n        \n        # If the length of s is less than x, we need to expand it.\n        if s_len < x:\n            # The new length is the current length plus the repeat_count times\n            # the length of the string to the right of the cursor.\n            s_len = (s_len + repeat_count * (s_len - i - 1)) % MOD\n        \n        # Move to the next character.\n        i += 1\n    \n    return s_len\n\n# Read the number of test cases\nt = int(input())\nfor _ in range(t):\n    # Read x and the initial string s for each test case\n    x = int(input())\n    s = input().strip()\n    \n    # Calculate and print the final length of s\n    print(calculate_length(x, s))\n```\n\nThis code reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the value of `x` and the initial string `s`. It then calculates the final length of `s` using the `calculate_length` function and prints the result. The `calculate_length` function simulates the process while only keeping track of the length of `s` and using modular arithmetic to handle large numbers."], "prompt_tokens": [1542], "completion_tokens": [957], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": false, "language": "Python3", "task_id": 2183}

The outer loop will iterate over the indices for the first 'Q', the middle loop for 'A', and the innermost loop for the second 'Q'. We need to ensure that the index of 'A' is greater than the index of the first 'Q' and the index of the second 'Q' is greater than the index of 'A'.\n\nHere's a step-by-step approach:\n1. Initialize a counter to zero. This will hold the number of \"QAQ\" subsequences found.\n2. Use a loop to iterate over the string with a variable, say `i`, which represents the index of the first 'Q'.\n3. Inside this loop, use another loop to iterate over the remaining part of the string with a variable, say `j`, which represents the index of 'A'. Ensure that `j` is greater than `i`.\n4. Inside the second loop, use a third loop to iterate over the remaining part of the string with a variable, say `k`, which represents the index of the second 'Q'. Ensure that `k` is greater than `j`.\n5. If at any point, the characters at indices `i`, `j`, and `k` form the subsequence \"QAQ\", increment the counter.\n6.

The solution involves dynamic programming to count the number of subsequences ending with 'a', 'b', and 'c'.\n\n2. **Distinct Subsequences**: Given a string S and a string T, count the number of distinct subsequences of S which equals T.

The algorithm will involve iterating through the list of psychos and using the stack to determine which psychos get killed.\n\n## Tutorial:\nA stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle. The two primary operations on a stack are `push` (add an element to the top of the stack) and `pop` (remove the top element from the stack).\n\nTo solve the problem using a stack, we can follow these steps:\n1. Initialize an empty stack.\n2. Iterate through the list of psychos from left to right.\n3. For each psycho, while the stack is not empty and the current psycho's id is greater than the id of the psycho at the top of the stack, pop the stack (this simulates the current psycho killing the one to his right).\n4. Push the current psycho's id onto the stack.\n5. Repeat steps 2-4 until no changes occur in the stack, which means no more killings can happen.\n6. The number of iterations needed to reach this stable state is the answer.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Balanced Parentheses**: Given a string of parentheses, determine if the string is balanced. A string is balanced if all open parentheses have a corresponding closing parenthesis in the correct order. The solution involves using a stack to keep track of the open parentheses and ensuring that they are properly closed in the correct order.\n\n2. **Nearest Greater Element**: Given an array of integers, find the nearest greater element for each element in the array. The nearest greater element for an element x is the first greater element on the right side of x in the array. The solution uses a stack to keep track of the elements and efficiently find the nearest greater element.\n\n3. **Histogram Area**: Given an array of integers representing the heights of bars in a histogram, find the largest rectangular area in the histogram. The solution involves using a stack to maintain the bars and calculate the area of the largest rectangle that can be formed with the stack bars as sides.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n```python\ndef calculate_steps(n, psychos):\n    stack = []\n    steps = 0\n    while True:\n        new_stack = []\n        for psycho in psychos:\n            while new_stack and psycho > new_stack[-1]:\n                new_stack.pop()\n            new_stack.append(psycho)\n        if len(new_stack) == len(stack):  # No change, stable state reached\n            break\n        else:\n            steps += 1\n            stack = new_stack.copy()\n    return steps\n\n# Read input from standard input\nn = int(input())\npsychos = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n# Call the function and print the result to standard output\nprint(calculate_steps(n, psychos))\n```\n\nTo use the code above, you would run the script and then input the number of psychos followed by the list of their ids.

In this case, we simulate the elevator's movement floor by floor and manage the boarding and deboarding of employees.\n\nThe greedy strategy is used to make local optimal choices at each step with the hope of finding a global optimum. In this problem, we need to decide the order of stops for the elevator to minimize the total time.

The DFS algorithm is used to traverse the tree and calculate the depth of each node. The greedy part comes into play when selecting the cities to develop industry in order to maximize the happiness of the envoys.\n\n## Tutorial:\nDepth-First Search (DFS) is a fundamental algorithm used to traverse or search tree or graph data structures. The algorithm starts at the root node (selecting some arbitrary node as the root in the case of a graph) and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.\n\nHere's a high-level overview of how DFS works:\n1. Start by putting any one of the graph's vertices on top of a stack.\n2. Take the top item of the stack and add it to the visited list.\n3. Create a list of that vertex's adjacent nodes. Add the ones which aren't in the visited list to the top of the stack.\n4. Keep repeating steps 2 and 3 until the stack is empty.\n\nThe greedy algorithm is an algorithmic paradigm that builds up a solution piece by piece, always choosing the next piece that offers the most immediate benefit. In this problem, the greedy choice is to select the cities that will maximize the happiness of the envoys.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Maximum Depth of N-ary Tree**: Given a n-ary tree, find its maximum depth. The maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.\n   Solution: Use DFS to traverse the tree and keep track of the depth as you go deeper into the tree. The maximum depth encountered during the traversal is the answer.\n\n2. **Number of Islands**: Given a 2D grid map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), count the number of islands. An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically.\n   Solution: Use DFS to traverse the grid. Each time a '1' is found, perform a DFS to mark all adjacent '1's as visited, effectively sinking the island. Increment the island count each time a new starting '1' is found.\n\n3. **Path Sum**: Given a binary tree and a sum, determine if the tree has a root-to-leaf path such that adding up all the values along the path equals the given sum.\n   Solution: Use DFS to traverse the tree, keeping track of the current sum. If a leaf node is reached and the current sum equals the target sum, return true. If the end of the tree is reached without finding such a path, return false.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\n1. Use DFS to calculate the depth of each city.\n2. Calculate the \"profit\" of making each city industrial, which is the depth of the city minus the number of industrial cities in its subtree (initially zero).\n3. Sort the cities by their profit in descending order.\n4. Select the top `k` cities to be industrial based on the sorted profits.\n5.

Backtracking is a general algorithm for finding all (or some) solutions to some computational problems, notably constraint satisfaction problems, that incrementally builds candidates to the solutions, and abandons a candidate (\"backtracks\") as soon as it determines that the candidate cannot possibly be completed to a valid solution.\n\nIn this problem, we need to find a permutation of integers picked from each box such that the sum of the numbers in each box after reordering is the same. We can use backtracking to try different permutations of the integers and check if any of them leads to the desired outcome.\n\n## Tutorial:\nBacktracking is often applied to solve constraint satisfaction problems. The idea is to explore all possible states of the solution space systematically. When the current state cannot lead to a solution, the algorithm discards the current state and goes back (backtracks) to the previous state to try a different path.\n\nHere's a general approach to backtracking algorithms:\n1. Define the solution space that contains all possible candidates for the solution.\n2. Define a function that can verify if a candidate can potentially be a solution (a partial solution).\n3. Define a function that checks if a candidate is a valid solution.\n4. Use recursion to iterate through the solution space, building partial solutions and extending them step by step.\n5. If a partial solution is identified as not leading to a valid solution, discard it and backtrack.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **N-Queens Problem**: Place N queens on an N\u00d7N chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other. The solution involves placing a queen on the board, then recursively attempting to place the next queen in a valid position. If no valid position is found, the algorithm backtracks and moves the previous queen.\n\n2. **Sudoku Solver**: Fill a 9\u00d79 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3\u00d73 subgrids that compose the grid contain all of the digits from 1 to 9. The backtracking algorithm tries to fill the grid with numbers, backtracking whenever a number cannot be placed in the remaining empty cells without violating the Sudoku rules.\n\n3. **Permutations of a String**: Given a string, write a function to compute all permutations of the string. The algorithm involves swapping characters in the string to generate new permutations and backtracking when all permutations for a given configuration are found.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\n1. Calculate the total sum of all numbers in all boxes.\n2. Check if the total sum is divisible by the number of boxes, k. If not, it's impossible to balance the boxes.\n3. If it is divisible, the target sum for each box is the total sum divided by k.\n4. Use backtracking to try different permutations of picking one number from each box and check if the sums can be made equal.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\ndef can_balance(k, boxes):\n    total_sum = sum(sum(box) for box in boxes)\n    if total_sum % k != 0:\n        return \"No\"\n    \n    target_sum = total_sum // k\n    for perm in permutations(range(k)):\n        if check_permutation(perm, boxes, target_sum):\n            return \"Yes\\n\" + \"\\n\".join(f\"{boxes[i][perm[i]]} {i+1}\" for i in range(k))\n    return \"No\"\n\ndef check_permutation(perm, boxes, target_sum):\n    new_sums = [0] * len(boxes)\n    for i, box in enumerate(boxes):\n        new_sums[i] = sum(box) - box[perm[i]]\n    for i, idx in enumerate(perm):\n        new_sums[idx] += boxes[i][perm[i]]\n    return all(s == target_sum for s in new_sums)\n\n# Read input\nk = int(input())\nboxes = []\nfor _ in range(k):\n    n_i, *box = map(int, input().split())\n    boxes.append(box)\n\n# Solve the problem\nresult = can_balance(k, boxes)\n\n# Print the output\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code reads the input, processes the boxes, and then attempts to find a valid permutation that balances the boxes.

The greedy algorithm is an approach for solving problems by making a sequence of choices, each of which simply looks the best at the moment. For this problem, at each step, we want to cut the largest carrot in such a way that the time taken to eat the resulting pieces is minimized.\n\n## Tutorial:\nA greedy algorithm builds up a solution piece by piece, always choosing the next piece that offers the most immediate benefit. In the context of this problem, the immediate benefit is the reduction in the total time taken for rabbits to eat the carrots.\n\nTo apply a greedy algorithm to this problem, we need to consider the following:\n- Cutting a carrot into two pieces increases the total time taken because two smaller pieces take more time to eat than one big piece (since time is proportional to the square of the size).\n- Therefore, we should aim to cut the carrots into pieces that are as equal as possible because the sum of squares is minimized when the numbers are close to each other.\n\nThe strategy is to always cut the largest carrot until we have enough pieces for all rabbits. When cutting a carrot, we should cut it into two pieces such that the difference in their sizes is minimized, which will also minimize the increase in the total time taken.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Activity Selection Problem**: Given a set of activities with start and end times, select the maximum number of activities that don't overlap. The solution is to use a greedy algorithm to always pick the next activity with the earliest finish time that is compatible with the selected activities.\n\n2. **Coin Change Problem**: Given an unlimited supply of coins of given denominations, find the minimum number of coins required to make a certain amount of change. The greedy algorithm picks the largest denomination of coins that is less than the current amount to be made and repeats this process until the amount becomes zero.\n\n3. **Fractional Knapsack Problem**: Given weights and values of items, put these items in a knapsack of a fixed capacity to get the maximum total value in the knapsack. The greedy algorithm sorts items by value-to-weight ratio and adds them to the knapsack, starting with the item with the highest ratio until the knapsack is full.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\n- Sort the carrots in descending order of their lengths.\n- Continuously cut the largest carrot into two pieces such that the difference in their sizes is minimized, and the pieces are still positive integers.\n- Stop when we have exactly $k$ pieces.\n- Calculate the sum of the squares of the lengths of all pieces.\n\n```python\nimport heapq\n\ndef min_time_to_eat_carrots(n, k, carrots):\n    # Create a max-heap of negative carrot sizes (since heapq is a min-heap)\n    max_heap = [-c for c in carrots]\n    heapq.heapify(max_heap)\n    \n    # The number of cuts needed to reach k pieces\n    cuts_needed = k - n\n    \n    while cuts_needed > 0:\n        # Take the largest carrot\n        largest_carrot = -heapq.heappop(max_heap)\n        # Calculate the optimal way to cut it\n        piece1 = largest_carrot // 2\n        piece2 = largest_carrot - piece1\n        # Add the two new pieces to the heap\n        heapq.heappush(max_heap, -piece1)\n        heapq.heappush(max_heap, -piece2)\n        cuts_needed -= 1\n    \n    # Calculate the sum of squares of the carrot sizes\n    total_time = sum(x * x for x in max_heap)\n    return -total_time\n\n# Read input from standard input\nn, k = map(int, input().split())\ncarrots = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n# Call the function and print the output to standard output\nprint(min_time_to_eat_carrots(n, k, carrots))\n```\n\nThis code will read the input, process the carrots using a greedy algorithm, and output the minimum sum of time taken for rabbits to eat the carrots."], "prompt_tokens": [674], "completion_tokens": [841], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": false, "language": "Python3", "task_id": 2170}

The problem can be solved using a mathematical approach that involves recognizing the pattern of addition and subtraction across the rows. This pattern can be observed by writing out the first few steps and looking for regularities. Once the pattern is identified, we can derive a formula to directly calculate the final result without performing all the operations.\n\n## Tutorial:\nTo solve this problem, we need to understand how the sequence of operations affects the final result. Let's consider a small example with 4 numbers: a, b, c, d.\n\n1. Start with the sequence: a, b, c, d\n2. Perform the operations: (a+b), (b-c), (c+d)\n3. Next row: (a+b)-(b-c), (b-c)+(c+d)\n4. Final result: ((a+b)-(b-c))+((b-c)+(c+d))\n\nIf we simplify the final result, we notice that some terms cancel out, and we are left with a formula that only depends on the initial numbers and their positions. For an even number of elements, the final result is the sum of the even-indexed numbers minus the sum of the odd-indexed numbers. For an odd number of elements, the final result is the sum of the odd-indexed numbers minus the sum of the even-indexed numbers, except for the last element which is added.\n\nThe key insight is that we do not need to perform all the operations; we can directly calculate the final result using the derived formula. This approach significantly reduces the time complexity from O(n^2) to O(n), where n is the number of elements.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Maximum Subarray Sum**: Given an array of integers, find the contiguous subarray which has the largest sum. The solution involves using Kadane's algorithm to keep track of the maximum subarray sum found so far and the current subarray sum.\n\n2. **Balanced Parentheses**: Given a string containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid. The solution uses a stack to ensure that each closing bracket matches the most recent unmatched opening bracket.\n\n3. **Stock Span Problem**: The stock span problem is a financial problem where we want to calculate the span of stock\u2019s price for all days. The span Si of the stock\u2019s price on a given day i is defined as the maximum number of consecutive days just before the given day, for which the price of the stock on the current day is less than or equal to its price on the given day. This can be solved using a stack to keep track of the indices of the days.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\nAs explained in the tutorial, we can directly calculate the final result by iterating through the array once and applying the derived formula based on the index of each element.\n\n```python\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\ndef calculate_final_number(n, numbers):\n    result = 0\n    # If n is odd, add the last element to the result as it will always be added in the final result\n    if n % 2 != 0:\n        result += numbers[-1]\n    \n    # Iterate through the numbers and apply the pattern\n    for i in range(n - 1):\n        if i % 2 == 0:\n            result += numbers[i]\n        else:\n            result -= numbers[i]\n    \n    # Return the non-negative remainder after dividing by MOD\n    return result % MOD\n\n# Read input from standard input\nn = int(input())\nnumbers = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n# Call the function and print the output to standard output\nprint(calculate_final_number(n, numbers))\n```\n\nThis code reads the number of elements and the elements themselves from standard input, calls the `calculate_final_number` function, and prints the result to standard output. The function calculates the final number according to the pattern described and returns the result modulo 10^9 + 7."], "prompt_tokens": [831], "completion_tokens": [843], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": false, "language": "Python3", "task_id": 2070}

The algorithms that can be used for finding the shortest paths are Dijkstra's algorithm or the Bellman-Ford algorithm, depending on whether the graph has negative weights or not. Since the problem statement does not mention negative weights, Dijkstra's algorithm is more suitable due to its better time complexity for graphs without negative weights.\n\n## Tutorial:\nDijkstra's algorithm is used to find the shortest paths from a single source to all other vertices in a graph with non-negative edge weights. The algorithm works as follows:\n\n1. Initialize distances from the source to all vertices as infinite and distance to the source itself as 0.\n2. Create a priority queue (min-heap) and insert the source with distance 0.\n3. While the priority queue is not empty:\n   a. Extract the vertex with the minimum distance from the priority queue.\n   b. For each adjacent vertex v of the extracted vertex u, if the distance to v through u is less than the current distance to v, update the distance to v and insert v into the priority queue.\n\nThe algorithm finishes when the priority queue is empty, and the shortest paths to all vertices are known.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Single Source Shortest Path (SSSP)**: Given a graph and a source vertex, find the shortest path from the source to all other vertices. Solution: Use Dijkstra's algorithm to compute the shortest paths.\n\n2. **Network Delay Time**: You are given a network of n nodes, labeled from 1 to n. You are also given times, a list of travel times as directed edges times[i] = (u, v, w), where u is the source node, v is the target node, and w is the time it takes for a signal to travel from source to target. Send a signal from a certain node k. Return the time it takes for all nodes to receive the signal. If it is impossible, return -1. Solution: Use Dijkstra's algorithm starting from node k to find the maximum time it takes to reach any node.\n\n3. **Cheapest Flights Within K Stops**: There are n cities connected by m flights. Each flight starts from city u and arrives at v with a price w. Given all the cities and flights, together with starting city src and the destination dst, your task is to find the cheapest price from src to dst with up to k stops.

The problem requires us to group the apples (numbers) in such a way that the GCD of the numbers in each group is greater than 1. This implies that we need to pair numbers that share a common factor other than 1.\n\n## Tutorial:\nTo solve this problem, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. **Identify Prime Numbers**: Since we need to pair numbers with a GCD greater than 1, we can start by identifying all prime numbers up to `n` because prime numbers do not pair with any other number except their multiples.\n\n2. **Grouping Multiples of Primes**: After identifying the primes, we can group the multiples of each prime number together. For example, if 2 is a prime, then numbers like 4, 6, 8, etc., can be grouped together.\n\n3. **Handling Remaining Numbers**: Once we have grouped all multiples of prime numbers, we may have some numbers left. These numbers will be the prime numbers themselves and any number that is not a multiple of a smaller prime. We can try to pair these remaining numbers with each other if possible.\n\n4. **Maximizing Groups**: To maximize the number of groups, we should start by pairing the largest numbers first, as they have fewer options for pairing.\n\n5. **Output**: Finally, we output the number of groups formed and the pairs in each group.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Goldbach's Conjecture**: Given an even number greater than 2, represent it as the sum of two prime numbers. The solution involves finding two prime numbers that add up to the given number, which can be done using a sieve algorithm to find primes and then checking pairs.\n\n2. **Prime Factorization**: Given a number `n`, find all the prime factors of `n`. The solution involves dividing `n` by each prime number up to the square root of `n` and recording the factors.\n\n3. **Coprime Pairs**: Given a range of numbers, find all pairs of numbers that are coprime (their GCD is 1). The solution involves checking each pair of numbers within the range and using the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\nWe will use the Sieve of Eratosthenes to find all prime numbers up to `n`. Then, we will iterate through the numbers from `n` to 1, trying to group them with their largest possible divisor (which is not 1).

{"name": "2047", "description": "Allen dreams of one day owning a enormous fleet of electric cars, the car of the future! He knows that this will give him a big status boost. As Allen is planning out all of the different types of cars he will own and how he will arrange them, he realizes that he has a problem. \n\nAllen's future parking lot can be represented as a rectangle with $4$ rows and $n$ ($n \\le 50$) columns of rectangular spaces, each of which can contain at most one car at any time. He imagines having $k$ ($k \\le 2n$) cars in the grid, and all the cars are initially in the second and third rows. Each of the cars also has a different designated parking space in the first or fourth row. Allen has to put the cars into corresponding parking places.\n\n [Image] Illustration to the first example. \n\nHowever, since Allen would never entrust his cars to anyone else, only one car can be moved at a time. He can drive a car from a space in any of the four cardinal directions to a neighboring empty space. Furthermore, Allen can only move one of his cars into a space on the first or fourth rows if it is the car's designated parking space. \n\nAllen knows he will be a very busy man, and will only have time to move cars at most $20000$ times before he realizes that moving cars is not worth his time. Help Allen determine if he should bother parking his cars or leave it to someone less important.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains two space-separated integers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \\le n \\le 50$, $1 \\le k \\le 2n$), representing the number of columns and the number of cars, respectively.\n\nThe next four lines will contain $n$ integers each between $0$ and $k$ inclusive, representing the initial state of the parking lot. The rows are numbered $1$ to $4$ from top to bottom and the columns are numbered $1$ to $n$ from left to right.\n\nIn the first and last line, an integer $1 \\le x \\le k$ represents a parking spot assigned to car $x$ (you can only move this car to this place), while the integer $0$ represents a empty space (you can't move any car to this place).\n\nIn the second and third line, an integer $1 \\le x \\le k$ represents initial position of car $x$, while the integer $0$ represents an empty space (you can move any car to this place).\n\nEach $x$ between $1$ and $k$ appears exactly once in the second and third line, and exactly once in the first and fourth line.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIf there is a sequence of moves that brings all of the cars to their parking spaces, with at most $20000$ car moves, then print $m$, the number of moves, on the first line. On the following $m$ lines, print the moves (one move per line) in the format $i$ $r$ $c$, which corresponds to Allen moving car $i$ to the neighboring space at row $r$ and column $c$.\n\nIf it is not possible for Allen to move all the cars to the correct spaces with at most $20000$ car moves, print a single line with the integer $-1$.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n4 5\n1 2 0 4\n1 2 0 4\n5 0 0 3\n0 5 0 3\n\nOutput\n6\n1 1 1\n2 1 2\n4 1 4\n3 4 4\n5 3 2\n5 4 2\n\nInput\n1 2\n1\n2\n1\n2\n\nOutput\n-1\n\nInput\n1 2\n1\n1\n2\n2\n\nOutput\n2\n1 1 1\n2 4 1\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample test case, all cars are in front of their spots except car $5$, which is in front of the parking spot adjacent.

The problem can be approached using a greedy algorithm, where we try to move each car to its designated spot in the least number of moves possible.

In the context of this problem, the greedy approach would involve moving each car to its designated spot as soon as possible without considering the future consequences.\n\nTo implement this, we can iterate over each car and try to move it to its designated spot. If a car is already in its designated spot, we do nothing. If a car is not in its designated spot, we move it towards its spot one step at a time. We need to be careful when moving cars to not block the path for other cars. If a car's path is blocked, we may need to temporarily move other cars out of the way.\n\nThe key to solving this problem is to carefully manage the moves so that we do not exceed the move limit and to ensure that we do not create a situation where a car cannot reach its designated spot.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **The Tower of Hanoi**: This is a classic problem that involves moving a stack of disks from one peg to another, with the constraint that a larger disk cannot be placed on top of a smaller disk. The solution involves a recursive algorithm that moves the disks in the optimal sequence.\n\n2. **The Maze Solver**: Given a maze with an entrance and an exit, the goal is to find a path from the entrance to the exit.

This can be solved using a greedy algorithm that schedules jobs based on their profit-to-deadline ratio.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\nThe solution involves simulating the process of moving cars to their designated spots. We iterate over each car and move it step by step towards its spot. If a car is in the way, we move it to an adjacent empty space temporarily. We keep track of the moves and ensure that we do not exceed the move limit.\n\n```python\ndef move_car(moves, car, dest_row, dest_col):\n    # Move the car to the destination row and column\n    while car_positions[car][0] != dest_row or car_positions[car][1] != dest_col:\n        current_row, current_col = car_positions[car]\n        if current_row != dest_row:\n            # Move vertically\n            next_row = current_row - 1 if current_row > dest_row else current_row + 1\n            moves.append((car, next_row, current_col))\n            car_positions[car] = (next_row, current_col)\n        else:\n            # Move horizontally\n            next_col = current_col - 1 if current_col > dest_col else current_col + 1\n            moves.append((car, current_row, next_col))\n            car_positions[car] = (current_row, next_col)\n\ndef solve_parking_lot(n, k, parking_lot):\n    moves = []\n    car_positions = {}\n    # Find initial positions of cars\n    for row in range(1, 5):\n        for col in range(n):\n            if parking_lot[row-1][col] != 0:\n                car_positions[parking_lot[row-1][col]] = (row, col)\n\n    # Move cars to their designated spots\n    for car in range(1, k+1):\n        dest_row = 1 if car_positions[car][0] == 3 else 4\n        dest_col = car_positions[car][1]\n        move_car(moves, car, dest_row, dest_col)\n\n    # Check if the number of moves is within the limit\n    if len(moves) > 20000:\n        return -1\n    else:\n        return moves\n\n# Read input\nn, k = map(int, input().split())\nparking_lot = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(4)]\n\n# Solve the problem\nresult = solve_parking_lot(n, k, parking_lot)\n\n# Print the output\nif result == -1:\n    print(result)\nelse:\n    print(len(result))\n    for move in result:\n        print(*move)\n```\n\nThis code defines a function `solve_parking_lot` that takes the number of columns `n`, the number of cars `k`, and the initial state of the parking lot as input. It then simulates the process of moving each car to its designated spot and outputs the sequence of moves if possible, or `-1` if it's not possible to park all cars within the move limit."], "prompt_tokens": [1241], "completion_tokens": [1070], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": false, "language": "Python3", "task_id": 2047}
{"name": "2026", "description": "Yaroslav is playing a game called \"Time\". The game has a timer showing the lifespan he's got left. As soon as the timer shows 0, Yaroslav's character dies and the game ends. Also, the game has n clock stations, station number i is at point (x_{i}, y_{i}) of the plane. As the player visits station number i, he increases the current time on his timer by a_{i}. The stations are for one-time use only, so if the player visits some station another time, the time on his timer won't grow.\n\nA player spends d\u00b7dist time units to move between stations, where dist is the distance the player has covered and d is some constant. The distance between stations i and j is determined as |x_{i} - x_{j}| + |y_{i} - y_{j}|.\n\nInitially, the player is at station number 1, and the player has strictly more than zero and strictly less than one units of time. At station number 1 one unit of money can increase the time on the timer by one time unit (you can buy only integer number of time units).\n\nNow Yaroslav is wondering, how much money he needs to get to station n.

The greedy algorithm will consider the trade-off between moving directly towards the final station and visiting intermediate stations to gain additional time, which can potentially save money in the long run.\n\n## Tutorial:\nA greedy algorithm is an algorithmic paradigm that follows the problem-solving heuristic of making the locally optimal choice at each stage with the hope of finding a global optimum. In the context of this problem, the greedy choice is to decide whether it is more cost-effective to move directly to the next station or to buy time at the current station.\n\nTo implement a greedy algorithm for this problem, you would:\n\n1. Calculate the distance between all pairs of stations.\n2. Start from the first station with an initial amount of time slightly less than one unit.\n3. At each station, decide whether to buy time or move to another station based on the cost-effectiveness.\n4. Keep track of the minimum amount of money spent to reach the final station.\n\nThe greedy algorithm works well for this problem because at each step, making the best local decision (minimizing cost) will lead to the overall best solution.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Minimum Number of Coins**: Given an unlimited supply of coins of given denominations, find the minimum number of coins required to make a certain amount of change.\n   - Solution: Use a greedy algorithm to always pick the largest denomination coin that does not exceed the remaining amount of change needed.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def minCoins(coins, m, V):\n         coins.sort(reverse=True)\n         ans = 0\n         for coin in coins:\n             if V >= coin:\n                 ans += V // coin\n                 V %= coin\n         return ans if V == 0 else -1\n     ```\n\n2. **Activity Selection Problem**: Given a set of activities with start and end times, select the maximum number of activities that do not overlap.\n   - Solution: Sort activities by their finish time and then use a greedy algorithm to select the next activity with the earliest finish time that does not conflict with the already selected activities.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def maxActivities(activities):\n         activities.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])\n         last_finish_time = 0\n         selected_activities = []\n         for activity in activities:\n             if activity[0] >= last_finish_time:\n                 selected_activities.append(activity)\n                 last_finish_time = activity[1]\n         return len(selected_activities)\n     ```\n\n3. **Fractional Knapsack Problem**: Given weights and values of n items, we need to put these items in a knapsack of capacity W to get the maximum total value in the knapsack.\n   - Solution: Use a greedy algorithm to take items in decreasing order of value/weight ratio until the knapsack is full.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def fractionalKnapsack(W, items):\n         items.sort(key=lambda x: x[1]/x[0], reverse=True)\n         total_value = 0\n         for weight, value in items:\n             if W >= weight:\n                 W -= weight\n                 total_value += value\n             else:\n                 total_value += value * (W / weight)\n                 break\n         return total_value\n     ```\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\n- Calculate the distance between each pair of stations.\n- Use a greedy approach to decide whether to buy time at the current station or move to the next station.\n- Keep track of the minimum money spent to reach the final station.\n\nPython3 code:\n```python\ndef min_money_to_reach_final_station(n, d, a, coordinates):\n    # Calculate the distance between each pair of stations\n    def distance(p1, p2):\n        return abs(p1[0] - p2[0]) + abs(p1[1] - p2[1])\n\n    # Initialize the amount of money needed to reach each station\n    money_needed = [float('inf')] * n\n    money_needed[0] = 0  # Starting at station 1 with 0 money\n\n    # Greedy algorithm to find the minimum money needed\n    for i in range(n - 1):\n        for j in range(i + 1, n):\n            dist = distance(coordinates[i], coordinates[j])\n            cost = d * dist - (a[j - 1] if j != n - 1 else 0)\n            money_needed[j] = min(money_needed[j], money_needed[i] + max(cost, 0))\n\n    return money_needed[-1]\n\n# Read input from standard input\nn, d = map(int, input().split())\na = [0] + list(map(int, input().split())) + [0]\ncoordinates = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]\n\n# Call the function and print the output\nprint(min_money_to_reach_final_station(n, d, a, coordinates))\n```\n\nThis code reads the input, processes it using the greedy algorithm described, and prints the minimum amount of money needed to reach the final station."], "prompt_tokens": [758], "completion_tokens": [1085], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": false, "language": "Python3", "task_id": 2026}

We need to consider two cases: days when Du can speak without getting muzzled (fun factor \u2264 m) and days when he will get muzzled (fun factor > m). We want to place the larger fun factors on days when Du won't get muzzled, but we also need to space them out to avoid the muzzle period.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Activity Selection Problem**: Given a set of activities with start and end times, select the maximum number of activities that don't overlap. The solution involves sorting the activities by their end times and then selecting activities greedily.\n2. **Coin Change Problem**: Given different denominations of coins and a total amount, find the minimum number of coins that make up that amount. The greedy approach works if the coin denominations are such that the larger denomination is always a multiple of the smaller one (e.g., U.S. coinage).\n3. **Fractional Knapsack Problem**: Given weights and values of items, put these items in a knapsack of a fixed capacity to get the maximum total value in the knapsack. Sort items by their value/weight ratio and then insert them into the knapsack greedily.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\n1. Sort the fun factors in descending order.\n2. Place the largest fun factors (greater than m) in such a way that they are spaced out by d days to avoid muzzling.\n3. Fill the remaining days with the smaller fun factors (less than or equal to m).\n4. Calculate the total fun factor.\n\n```python\ndef max_fun_factor(n, d, m, fun_factors):\n    fun_factors.sort(reverse=True)\n    # Separate the fun factors into two lists: one for those that will cause muzzling and one for those that won't\n    high = [x for x in fun_factors if x > m]\n    low = [x for x in fun_factors if x <= m]\n    \n    # Calculate the maximum number of high fun factors we can have without being muzzled\n    max_high = (n - len(high) + d) // (d + 1)\n    max_high = min(max_high, len(high))\n    \n    # Calculate the total fun factor\n    total_fun = sum(high[:max_high])\n    remaining_days = n - max_high * (d + 1)\n    \n    # Add the fun factors from the low list\n    if remaining_days > 0:\n        total_fun += sum(low[:remaining_days])\n        low = low[remaining_days:]\n    \n    # Add the remaining high fun factors, if any, interleaved with the low fun factors\n    for i in range(len(high) - max_high):\n        total_fun += high[max_high + i]\n        if i < len(low):\n            total_fun += sum(low[i * d:(i + 1) * d])\n    \n    return total_fun\n\n# Read input from standard input\nn, d, m = map(int, input().split())\nfun_factors = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n# Call the function and print the output to standard output\nprint(max_fun_factor(n, d, m, fun_factors))\n```\n\nThis code will read the input, process the fun factors according to the strategy described, and output the maximum total fun factor."], "prompt_tokens": [794], "completion_tokens": [843], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": false, "language": "Python3", "task_id": 2146}

He has already made n tasks, for each task the boy evaluated how interesting it is as an integer q_{i}, and the time t_{i} in minutes needed to complete the task. \n\nAn interesting feature of his quest is: each participant should get the task that is best suited for him, depending on his preferences. The task is chosen based on an interactive quiz that consists of some questions. The player should answer these questions with \"yes\" or \"no\". Depending on the answer to the question, the participant either moves to another question or goes to one of the tasks that are in the quest. In other words, the quest is a binary tree, its nodes contain questions and its leaves contain tasks. \n\nWe know that answering any of the questions that are asked before getting a task takes exactly one minute from the quest player. Polycarp knows that his friends are busy people and they can't participate in the quest for more than T minutes. Polycarp wants to choose some of the n tasks he made, invent the corresponding set of questions for them and use them to form an interactive quiz as a binary tree so that no matter how the player answers quiz questions, he spends at most T minutes on completing the whole quest (that is, answering all the questions and completing the task). Specifically, the quest can contain zero questions and go straight to the task. Each task can only be used once (i.e., the people who give different answers to questions should get different tasks).\n\nPolycarp wants the total \"interest\" value of the tasks involved in the quest to be as large as possible. Help him determine the maximum possible total interest value of the task considering that the quest should be completed in T minutes at any variant of answering questions.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and T (1 \u2264 n \u2264 1000, 1 \u2264 T \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of tasks made by Polycarp and the maximum time a quest player should fit into.\n\nNext n lines contain two integers t_{i}, q_{i} (1 \u2264 t_{i} \u2264 T, 1 \u2264 q_{i} \u2264 1000) each \u2014 the time in minutes needed to complete the i-th task and its interest value.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint a single integer \u2014 the maximum possible total interest value of all the tasks in the quest.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n5 5\n1 1\n1 1\n2 2\n3 3\n4 4\n\nOutput\n11\n\nInput\n5 5\n4 1\n4 2\n4 3\n4 4\n4 5\n\nOutput\n9\n\nInput\n2 2\n1 1\n2 10\n\nOutput\n10\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample test all the five tasks can be complemented with four questions and joined into one quest.\n\nIn the second sample test it is impossible to use all the five tasks, but you can take two of them, the most interesting ones.\n\nIn the third sample test the optimal strategy is to include only the second task into the quest.\n\nHere is the picture that illustrates the answers to the sample tests.

It doesn't always guarantee an optimal solution, but it's often used because it's fast and easy to implement.\n\nTo apply a Greedy Algorithm to this problem, we need to sort the tasks based on some criteria that reflect their desirability. Since we want to maximize the total interest and we have a time constraint, a natural choice is to sort the tasks by their interest-to-time ratio in descending order. This way, we prioritize tasks that offer the most interest per unit of time.\n\nOnce the tasks are sorted, we start selecting tasks from the top of the sorted list and keep track of the time spent on questions and tasks. We stop when adding another task would exceed the time limit T.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Fractional Knapsack Problem**: Given weights and values of n items, we need to put these items in a knapsack of capacity W to get the maximum total value in the knapsack.

Then use a greedy algorithm to take as much as possible of the item with the highest ratio until the knapsack is full.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def fractionalKnapsack(capacity, weights, values):\n         ratio = [(v / w, w) for v, w in zip(values, weights)]\n         ratio.sort(reverse=True)\n         total_value = 0\n         for value_per_weight, weight in ratio:\n             if capacity >= weight:\n                 total_value += value_per_weight * weight\n                 capacity -= weight\n             else:\n                 total_value += value_per_weight * capacity\n                 break\n         return total_value\n     ```\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\nThe solution involves iterating through each vector and deciding whether to add or subtract it from the current position. We will choose the option that results in a position closer to the origin. We can do this by comparing the magnitude of the position vector after adding or subtracting the current move vector.\n\nPython3 code to solve the problem:\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_distance(x, y):\n    return math.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)\n\ndef find_sequence_of_moves(n, vectors):\n    x, y = 0, 0  # Starting at the origin\n    sequence = []\n    for vx, vy in vectors:\n        # Calculate the distance if we add or subtract the current vector\n        add_dist = calculate_distance(x + vx, y + vy)\n        sub_dist = calculate_distance(x - vx, y - vy)\n        # Choose the option that minimizes the distance from the origin\n        if add_dist < sub_dist:\n            x += vx\n            y += vy\n            sequence.append(1)\n        else:\n            x -= vx\n            y -= vy\n            sequence.append(-1)\n    return sequence\n\n# Read input\nn = int(input())\nvectors = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]\n\n# Find and print the sequence of moves\nsequence = find_sequence_of_moves(n, vectors)\nprint(' '.join(map(str, sequence)))\n```\n\nThis code will read the input, process the vectors, and output the sequence of moves that keeps Allen within a safe distance from the origin."], "prompt_tokens": [817], "completion_tokens": [1036], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": false, "language": "Python3", "task_id": 2009}

This mistake have been fixed and the current given problem statement and model solution corresponds to what jury wanted it to be during the contest.\n\nVova and Lesha are friends. They often meet at Vova's place and compete against each other in a computer game named The Ancient Papyri: Swordsink. Vova always chooses a warrior as his fighter and Leshac chooses an archer. After that they should choose initial positions for their characters and start the fight. A warrior is good at melee combat, so Vova will try to make the distance between fighters as small as possible. An archer prefers to keep the enemy at a distance, so Lesha will try to make the initial distance as large as possible.\n\nThere are n (n is always even) possible starting positions for characters marked along the Ox axis. The positions are given by their distinct coordinates x_1, x_2, ..., x_{n}, two characters cannot end up at the same position.\n\nVova and Lesha take turns banning available positions, Vova moves first. During each turn one of the guys bans exactly one of the remaining positions. Banned positions cannot be used by both Vova and Lesha. They continue to make moves until there are only two possible positions remaining (thus, the total number of moves will be n - 2). After that Vova's character takes the position with the lesser coordinate and Lesha's character takes the position with the bigger coordinate and the guys start fighting.\n\nVova and Lesha are already tired by the game of choosing positions, as they need to play it before every fight, so they asked you (the developer of the The Ancient Papyri: Swordsink) to write a module that would automatically determine the distance at which the warrior and the archer will start fighting if both Vova and Lesha play optimally.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line on the input contains a single integer n (2 \u2264 n \u2264 200 000, n is even)\u00a0\u2014 the number of positions available initially.

The greedy strategy is used to simulate the optimal moves of Vova and Lesha, while sorting is used to arrange the positions in a way that makes it easier to determine the final positions after all the banning moves have been made.\n\n## Tutorial:\nA greedy algorithm is an algorithmic paradigm that follows the problem-solving heuristic of making the locally optimal choice at each stage with the hope of finding a global optimum. In the context of this problem, the greedy approach would involve each player making the best possible move at each turn to maximize their own advantage.\n\nSorting is a fundamental operation in computer science that involves arranging the elements of a list or array in a certain order (typically in ascending or descending order). In this problem, sorting the initial positions will allow us to easily determine which positions are left after each player has banned positions.\n\nTo solve this problem, we can follow these steps:\n1. Sort the initial positions in ascending order.\n2. Since Vova wants to minimize the distance and Lesha wants to maximize it, we can simulate the banning process by removing positions from the ends of the sorted list. Vova will ban the position closest to the median on the right, and Lesha will ban the position closest to the median on the left.\n3. After n-2 bans, there will be two positions left. The distance between these two positions is the answer.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Activity Selection Problem**: Given a set of activities with start and end times, select the maximum number of activities that don't overlap. The solution involves sorting the activities by their end times and then using a greedy approach to select activities.\n\n2. **Fractional Knapsack Problem**: Given weights and values of n items, we need to put these items in a knapsack of capacity W to get the maximum total value in the knapsack. This problem is solved by sorting items by their value/weight ratio and then using a greedy approach to select items.\n\n3. **Job Sequencing Problem**: Given a set of jobs with deadlines and profits, the task is to schedule jobs in a way that maximizes total profit and each job is completed within its deadline. The solution involves sorting the jobs by their profits and then using a greedy approach to schedule jobs.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\n- First, we sort the positions.\n- Then, we simulate the banning process. Since Vova starts first and wants to minimize the distance, he will ban the position just after the median. Lesha will ban the position just before the median.\n- After n-2 bans, the remaining two positions will be the median positions of the original sorted list.

The greedy algorithm works by making the locally optimal choice at each stage with the hope of finding a global optimum. In this case, we need to check if there is any configuration of weights that allows Alice's total weight to be strictly larger than Bob's.\n\n## Tutorial:\nA greedy algorithm is an approach for solving a problem by selecting the best option available at the moment, without worrying about the complexity of the future. It doesn't always guarantee an optimal solution, but it's often used because it's fast and easy to implement.\n\nThe greedy algorithm works in phases. At each phase:\n- You take the best you can get right now, without regard for future consequences.\n- You hope that by choosing a local optimum at each step, you will end up at a global optimum.\n\nIn the context of this problem, we can use a greedy approach by comparing the highest fish type caught by Alice with the highest fish type caught by Bob. If Alice has caught a fish of a type that Bob hasn't, then it's always possible to assign weights such that Alice's total weight is strictly larger. If not, and if Alice's fish types are all subsets of Bob's, then it's impossible for Alice to have a strictly larger total weight.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Coin Change Problem**: Given an unlimited supply of coins of given denominations, find the minimum number of coins required to make a change for a given value. The greedy algorithm selects the largest denomination coin that is less than the current value and subtracts it from the value, repeating this process until the value becomes zero.\n\n2. **Activity Selection Problem**: Given a set of activities with start and end times, select the maximum number of activities that don't overlap. The greedy algorithm sorts activities by their finishing times and selects the first activity, then selects the next activity with a start time greater than or equal to the finish time of the previously selected activity, and repeats this process.\n\n3. **Fractional Knapsack Problem**: Given weights and values of n items, we need to put these items in a knapsack of capacity W to get the maximum total value in the knapsack. The greedy algorithm sorts items by their value/weight ratio and adds them to the knapsack, starting with the item with the highest ratio until the knapsack is full.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\n- Read the input values for n, m, k, Alice's fish types, and Bob's fish types.\n- Sort both Alice's and Bob's fish types.\n- Compare the highest fish type caught by Alice with the highest fish type caught by Bob.\n- If Alice has caught a fish of a type that Bob hasn't, print \"YES\".\n- If all of Alice's fish types are subsets of Bob's, print \"NO\".\n\n```python\n# Read input values\nn, m, k = map(int, input().split())\nalice_fish = list(map(int, input().split()))\nbob_fish = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n# Sort the fish types\nalice_fish.sort(reverse=True)\nbob_fish.sort(reverse=True)\n\n# Initialize pointers for Alice's and Bob's fish\nalice_ptr, bob_ptr = 0, 0\n\n# Compare the fish types\nwhile alice_ptr < n and bob_ptr < m:\n    if alice_fish[alice_ptr] > bob_fish[bob_ptr]:\n        print(\"YES\")\n        break\n    elif alice_fish[alice_ptr] < bob_fish[bob_ptr]:\n        bob_ptr += 1\n    else:\n        alice_ptr += 1\n        bob_ptr += 1\nelse:\n    # If we have compared all of Alice's fish and haven't printed \"YES\" yet\n    if alice_ptr < n:\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n```\n\nThis code will correctly determine whether it's possible for Alice's fish to have a strictly larger total weight than Bob's by comparing the types of fish they've caught."], "prompt_tokens": [744], "completion_tokens": [840], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": false, "language": "Python3", "task_id": 2075}

The MST is a subset of the edges of a connected, edge-weighted undirected graph that connects all the vertices together, without any cycles and with the minimum possible total edge weight. After finding the MST, we need to find the shortest path from the king's residence to each settlement.\n\nThe algorithms that can be used for this problem are:\n1. Kruskal's Algorithm or Prim's Algorithm for finding the MST.\n2. Dijkstra's Algorithm or Breadth-First Search (BFS) for finding the shortest path in the MST.\n\n## Tutorial:\n### Kruskal's Algorithm:\nKruskal's algorithm is a greedy algorithm that finds a minimum spanning tree for a connected weighted graph. The steps are as follows:\n1. Sort all the edges in non-decreasing order of their weight.\n2. Pick the smallest edge. Check if it forms a cycle with the spanning tree formed so far. If not, add it to the spanning tree.\n3. Repeat step 2 until there are (V-1) edges in the spanning tree, where V is the number of vertices.\n\n### Prim's Algorithm:\nPrim's algorithm is another greedy algorithm that finds a minimum spanning tree for a connected weighted graph. The steps are:\n1. Start with any vertex as the current vertex.\n2. Find the edge with the smallest weight that connects the current vertex to any vertex not yet in the MST and add it to the MST.\n3. Update the current vertex to the vertex at the other end of the added edge.\n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until all vertices are included in the MST.\n\n### Dijkstra's Algorithm:\nDijkstra's algorithm is used for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph, which may represent, for example, road networks. It works for graphs with non-negative edge weights. The steps are:\n1. Mark all nodes unvisited. Create a set of all the unvisited nodes called the unvisited set.\n2. Assign to every node a tentative distance value: set it to zero for the initial node and to infinity for all other nodes.\n3. For the current node, consider all of its unvisited neighbors and calculate their tentative distances through the current node. Compare the newly calculated tentative distance to the current assigned value and assign the smaller one.\n4. When we are done considering all of the unvisited neighbors of the current node, mark the current node as visited. A visited node will not be checked again.\n5. If the destination node has been marked visited or if the smallest tentative distance among the nodes in the unvisited set is infinity, then stop. The algorithm has finished.\n6. Otherwise, select the unvisited node that is marked with the smallest tentative distance, set it as the new \"current node,\" and go back to step 3.\n\n### Breadth-First Search (BFS):\nBFS is a traversing algorithm for searching tree or graph data structures. It starts at the tree root and explores the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level. It can be used to find the shortest path in an unweighted graph.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Minimum Spanning Tree**: Given a connected, undirected graph with weighted edges, find the minimum spanning tree of the graph. This problem can be solved using Kruskal's or Prim's algorithm.\n\n2. **Shortest Path in a Graph**: Given a graph and a source vertex, find the shortest paths from the source to all other vertices in the graph.

A matryoshka with a smaller number can be nested in a matryoshka with a higher number, two matryoshkas can not be directly nested in the same doll, but there may be chain nestings, for example, 1 \u2192 2 \u2192 4 \u2192 5. \n\nIn one second, you can perform one of the two following operations:  Having a matryoshka a that isn't nested in any other matryoshka and a matryoshka b, such that b doesn't contain any other matryoshka and is not nested in any other matryoshka, you may put a in b;  Having a matryoshka a directly contained in matryoshka b, such that b is not nested in any other matryoshka, you may get a out of b. \n\nAccording to the modern aesthetic norms the matryoshka dolls on display were assembled in a specific configuration, i.e. as several separate chains of nested matryoshkas, but the criminal, following the mysterious plan, took out all the dolls and assembled them into a single large chain (1 \u2192 2 \u2192 ... \u2192 n). In order to continue the investigation Andrewid needs to know in what minimum time it is possible to perform this action.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains integers n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5) and k (1 \u2264 k \u2264 10^5) \u2014 the number of matryoshkas and matryoshka chains in the initial configuration.\n\nThe next k lines contain the descriptions of the chains: the i-th line first contains number m_{i} (1 \u2264 m_{i} \u2264 n), and then m_{i} numbers a_{i}1, a_{i}2, ..., a_{im}_{i} \u2014 the numbers of matryoshkas in the chain (matryoshka a_{i}1 is nested into matryoshka a_{i}2, that is nested into matryoshka a_{i}3, and so on till the matryoshka a_{im}_{i} that isn't nested into any other matryoshka).\n\nIt is guaranteed that m_1 + m_2 + ... + m_{k} = n, the numbers of matryoshkas in all the chains are distinct, in each chain the numbers of matryoshkas follow in the ascending order.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIn the single line print the minimum number of seconds needed to assemble one large chain from the initial configuration.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3 2\n2 1 2\n1 3\n\nOutput\n1\n\nInput\n7 3\n3 1 3 7\n2 2 5\n2 4 6\n\nOutput\n10\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample test there are two chains: 1 \u2192 2 and 3. In one second you can nest the first chain into the second one and get 1 \u2192 2 \u2192 3.\n\nIn the second sample test you need to disassemble all the three chains into individual matryoshkas in 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 seconds and then assemble one big chain in 6 seconds.", "difficulty": "competition", "id": 2065, "sample_io": [{"input": "3 2\n2 1 2\n1 3\n", "output": ["1\n"]}, {"input": "7 3\n3 1 3 7\n2 2 5\n2 4 6\n", "output": ["10\n"]}], "test_list": [{"input": "3 2\n2 1 2\n1 3\n", "output": ["1\n"]}, {"input": "7 3\n3 1 3 7\n2 2 5\n2 4 6\n", "output": ["10\n"]}, {"input": "1 1\n1 1\n", "output": ["0\n"]}, {"input": "3 2\n1 2\n2 1 3\n", "output": ["3\n"]}, {"input": "5 3\n1 4\n3 1 2 3\n1 5\n", "output": ["2\n"]}, {"input": "8 5\n2 1 2\n2 3 4\n1 5\n2 6 7\n1 8\n", "output": ["8\n"]}, {"input": "10 10\n1 5\n1 4\n1 10\n1 3\n1 7\n1 1\n1 8\n1 6\n1 9\n1 2\n", "output": ["9\n"]}, {"input": "20 6\n3 8 9 13\n3 4 14 20\n2 15 17\n3 2 5 11\n5 7 10 12 18 19\n4 1 3 6 16\n", "output": ["33\n"]}, {"input": "50 10\n6 17 21 31 42 45 49\n6 11 12 15 22 26 38\n3 9 29 36\n3 10 23 43\n5 14 19 28 46 48\n2 30 39\n6 13 20 24 33 37 47\n8 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\n7 16 18 25 27 34 40 44\n4 32 35 41 50\n", "output": ["75\n"]}, {"input": "13 8\n1 5\n2 8 10\n1 13\n4 1 2 3 11\n1 7\n2 6 12\n1 4\n1 9\n", "output": ["13\n"]}, {"input": "21 13\n1 18\n2 8 13\n1 21\n1 17\n2 7 9\n1 20\n1 19\n1 4\n1 16\n2 5 6\n3 12 14 15\n3 1 2 3\n2 10 11\n", "output": ["24\n"]}, {"input": "50 50\n1 2\n1 5\n1 28\n1 46\n1 42\n1 24\n1 3\n1 37\n1 33\n1 50\n1 23\n1 40\n1 43\n1 26\n1 49\n1 34\n1 8\n1 45\n1 15\n1 1\n1 22\n1 18\n1 27\n1 25\n1 13\n1 39\n1 38\n1 10\n1 44\n1 6\n1 17\n1 47\n1 7\n1 35\n1 20\n1 36\n1 31\n1 21\n1 32\n1 29\n1 4\n1 12\n1 19\n1 16\n1 11\n1 41\n1 9\n1 14\n1 30\n1 48\n", "output": ["49\n"]}, {"input": "100 3\n45 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 19 21 24 27 28 30 34 35 37 39 40 41 42 43 46 47 48 51 52 55 58 59 61 63 64 66 69 71 76 80 85 86 88 89 94 99\n26 10 11 15 18 23 29 31 33 36 38 44 49 54 56 60 62 65 75 78 82 83 84 95 96 97 98\n29 12 13 14 16 17 20 22 25 26 32 45 50 53 57 67 68 70 72 73 74 77 79 81 87 90 91 92 93 100\n", "output": ["180\n"]}, {"input": "100 19\n6 62 72 83 91 94 97\n3 61 84 99\n1 63\n5 46 53 56 69 78\n5 41 43 49 74 89\n5 55 57 79 85 87\n3 47 59 98\n3 64 76 82\n3 48 66 75\n2 60 88\n2 67 77\n4 40 51 73 95\n41 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 44 71 81\n4 58 65 90 93\n1 100\n5 39 45 52 80 86\n2 50 68\n1 92\n4 42 54 70 96\n", "output": ["106\n"]}], "starter_code": "", "source_codes": ["\ndef min_seconds_to_assemble(n, k, chains):\n    correct_order = 0  # Number of dolls in the correct order\n    for chain in chains:\n        # Check if the chain starts with the next expected doll\n        if chain[0] == correct_order + 1:\n            # Count how many dolls are in the correct order in this chain\n            for doll in chain:\n                if doll == correct_order + 1:\n                    correct_order += 1\n                else:\n                    break\n        else:\n            break\n    # The minimum number of seconds is the total dolls minus the ones in correct order\n    return n - correct_order\n\n# Read input from standard input\nn, k = map(int, input().split())\nchains = []\nfor _ in range(k):\n    chain = list(map(int, input().split()))[1:]  # Skip the first element which is the length of the chain\n    chains.append(chain)\n\n# Call the function and print the result to standard output\nprint(min_seconds_to_assemble(n, k, chains))\n\n\n"], "responses": ["## Algorithms:\nThe core concept to solve this problem is greedy algorithm and understanding the structure of the nested matryoshka dolls. The greedy approach is used to minimize the number of operations by taking the best possible move at each step.\n\n## Tutorial:\nA greedy algorithm is an approach for solving problems by choosing the locally optimal solution at each step with the hope of finding the global optimum. In the context of this problem, the greedy approach involves finding the longest chain of nested dolls starting from 1 and extending as far as possible without any breaks. This is because any such chain does not require any additional moves to assemble, as it is already in the correct order.\n\nThe steps to solve the problem using a greedy algorithm are as follows:\n1. Identify the longest chain starting from doll 1.\n2. Count the number of dolls in this chain. Let's call this count `correct_order`.\n3. The minimum number of seconds needed will be `n - correct_order`, because for each doll not in the correct order, we need one second to either nest or take out a doll.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Activity Selection Problem**: Given a set of activities with start and end times, select the maximum number of activities that don't overlap. The greedy algorithm selects the next activity with the earliest finish time that doesn't conflict with the already selected activities.\n\n2. **Coin Change Problem**: Given an unlimited supply of coins of given denominations, find the minimum number of coins required to make a certain amount of change. The greedy algorithm always selects the coin with the highest value that does not exceed the remaining amount of change needed.\n\n3. **Fractional Knapsack Problem**: Given weights and values of n items, we need to put these items in a knapsack of capacity W to get the maximum total value in the knapsack. The greedy algorithm uses the idea of density (value/weight) and always selects the item with the highest density that fits in the remaining capacity of the knapsack.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\n- We will iterate through each chain and look for the longest chain starting with 1 and increasing by 1 with each nested doll.\n- We will keep track of the number of dolls in the correct order.\n- The minimum number of seconds needed will be the total number of dolls minus the number of dolls in the correct order.\n\n```python\ndef min_seconds_to_assemble(n, k, chains):\n    correct_order = 0  # Number of dolls in the correct order\n    for chain in chains:\n        # Check if the chain starts with the next expected doll\n        if chain[0] == correct_order + 1:\n            # Count how many dolls are in the correct order in this chain\n            for doll in chain:\n                if doll == correct_order + 1:\n                    correct_order += 1\n                else:\n                    break\n        else:\n            break\n    # The minimum number of seconds is the total dolls minus the ones in correct order\n    return n - correct_order\n\n# Read input from standard input\nn, k = map(int, input().split())\nchains = []\nfor _ in range(k):\n    chain = list(map(int, input().split()))[1:]  # Skip the first element which is the length of the chain\n    chains.append(chain)\n\n# Call the function and print the result to standard output\nprint(min_seconds_to_assemble(n, k, chains))\n```\n\nTo use the above code, you would provide the input in the specified format.

They require linear time to build and can be used to find sums, minimums, maximums, etc., over a range of elements in an array.\n\nTo use a segment tree for this problem, you would build a tree where each node contains the maximum and second maximum of the range it represents.

To find the GCD of two numbers `a` and `b`, where `a > b`, we repeatedly replace `a` with `a % b` (the remainder of `a` divided by `b`) and swap `a` and `b` if `a < b`, until `b` becomes 0. The GCD is the last non-zero remainder.\n\n### LCM using GCD:\nThe LCM of two numbers can be calculated using their GCD with the formula `lcm(a, b) = abs(a*b) / gcd(a, b)`.

This problem can be solved by iterating over all subsegments and calculating the LCM using the GCD.\n\n3. **Common Divisors**: Given two numbers, find the number of common divisors they have. This problem can be solved by first finding the GCD of the two numbers and then counting the number of divisors of the GCD.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\nTo solve the original problem, we will first calculate the LCM of all pairs of elements in the sequence. Since we are interested in the GCD of these LCMs, we can optimize the process by keeping track of the GCD as we calculate each LCM. We start with the first element and calculate its LCM with all other elements, updating the GCD as we go. We then repeat this process for the second element and the remaining elements, and so on. This way, we avoid storing all LCM values and directly compute the GCD.\n\nHere is the Python3 code to solve the problem:\n\n```python\nfrom math import gcd\n\ndef gcd_of_lcms(n, a):\n    # Initialize the gcd_result with the first element\n    gcd_result = a[0]\n    \n    # Calculate the LCM of each pair and update the gcd_result\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(i+1, n):\n            # Calculate LCM using GCD\n            lcm = a[i] * a[j] // gcd(a[i], a[j])\n            # Update the gcd_result with the current LCM\n            gcd_result = gcd(gcd_result, lcm)\n    \n    return gcd_result\n\n# Read input from standard input\nn = int(input())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n# Call the function and print the result to standard output\nprint(gcd_of_lcms(n, a))\n```\n\nNote: The above code has a time complexity of O(n^2 * log(max(a_i))), which may not be efficient for large inputs.

The problem requires us to calculate the probability of each vertex being the final label after repeatedly shrinking random edges. To do this, we need to consider the structure of the tree and the probabilities of each edge being chosen at each step.\n\n## Tutorial:\nTrees are a special kind of graph that are connected and acyclic. This means there is exactly one path between any two vertices. In this problem, we are interested in the process of shrinking edges until only one vertex remains.\n\nDynamic programming is a method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems. It is applicable when the problem can be divided into overlapping subproblems that can be solved independently.\n\nTo solve this problem using DP, we need to calculate the probability of each vertex being the final label. We can do this by considering the probability of each edge being chosen and the probability of each vertex label being retained after an edge is shrunk.\n\nThe key insight is that the probability of a vertex being the final label is equal to the sum of the probabilities of it being the final label after any of its adjacent edges is shrunk. Since the tree is shrinking, we can start from the leaves and work our way up to the root, updating the probabilities as we go.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Counting Leaves in a Tree**: Given a tree, count the number of leaf nodes. This problem can be solved by traversing the tree and counting nodes with degree 1.\n2. **Diameter of a Tree**: Find the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This can be solved using two depth-first searches (DFS) - one to find the farthest node from an arbitrary starting node, and another from the farthest node found in the first search.\n3. **Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA)**: Given two nodes in a tree, find their lowest common ancestor. This can be solved using various methods such as binary lifting or Euler tour with a segment tree or sparse table.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\nWe will use a recursive function to calculate the probability of each vertex being the final label. We will start by initializing the probabilities of all vertices to 1, as initially, each vertex has a probability of 1 of being itself.

It is applicable to problems exhibiting the properties of overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure. When solving a problem using dynamic programming, you solve each subproblem only once and store the results in a table (generally an array or a matrix) to avoid the work of recomputing the answer every time the subproblem is encountered.\n\nFor this beacon problem, we can use dynamic programming to keep track of the minimum number of beacons destroyed after activating each beacon. We will create an array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the minimum number of beacons destroyed after activating the `i-th` beacon. To fill this array, we will iterate through the beacons in reverse order and for each beacon, we will calculate the index of the next beacon that would not be destroyed if the current beacon is activated. This can be done by subtracting the power level of the current beacon from its position and using binary search to find the next beacon's index. Once we have this index, we can use it to update the `dp` array.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS)**: Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest increasing subsequence. The solution involves dynamic programming where `dp[i]` represents the length of the LIS ending at index `i`. For each element, you iterate through the previous elements to find the length of the longest subsequence that can be extended by the current element.\n\n2. **Coin Change**: Given an unlimited supply of coins of given denominations and a total amount of money, find the minimum number of coins needed to make up that amount. The dynamic programming solution involves creating an array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the minimum number of coins needed to make up the amount `i`.

The greedy approach involves making the locally optimal choice at each step with the hope of finding the global optimum. In this case, we need to minimize the cost of operations to make string `a` equal to string `b`. The operations are either flipping a bit at a cost of 1 or swapping two bits at a cost of their distance.\n\n## Tutorial:\nTo solve this problem using a greedy approach, we need to iterate through both strings and compare them bit by bit. If the bits at the current position are different, we have two choices: either flip the bit in string `a` or find a bit further in the string that can be swapped. The decision on which operation to perform is based on the cost:\n\n1. If flipping the bit is cheaper than any possible swap, we flip the bit.\n2. If there is a bit further in the string that can be swapped with a lower cost than flipping, we perform the swap.\n\nThe key to minimizing the cost is to always choose the operation with the lowest cost. When considering swaps, we need to keep track of the positions of mismatched bits to find potential swap candidates efficiently.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Minimum Swaps to Make Sequences Increasing**: You are given two integer arrays `A` and `B` of the same length, where `A[i]` and `B[i]` represent the ith element of the arrays. You are allowed to swap elements `A[i]` and `B[i]`. Find the minimum number of swaps to make both sequences strictly increasing.

Find the minimum number of operations required to convert `str1` to `str2`.\n   - Insert a character\n   - Remove a character\n   - Replace a character\n   The solution involves using dynamic programming to find the minimum number of operations, known as the edit distance problem.\n\n3. **Minimum Moves to Equal Array Elements II**: Given a non-empty integer array, find the minimum number of moves required to make all array elements equal, where a move is incrementing or decrementing an element by 1. The solution involves finding the median of the array and calculating the sum of absolute differences between each element and the median.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\nWe iterate through the strings `a` and `b` and compare them bit by bit. If the bits are different, we flip the bit in `a` since swapping would always be more expensive or equal in cost to flipping.

It works by repeatedly dividing in half the portion of the list that could contain the item until you've narrowed the possible locations to just one.

It is applicable to problems exhibiting the properties of overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure. When a problem can be divided into overlapping subproblems, which are smaller versions of the original problem, and the optimal solution to the original problem can be constructed from the optimal solutions to the subproblems, dynamic programming is a viable approach.\n\nFor this labyrinth problem, we can use a 2D DP table where `dp[i][j]` represents the number of ways to reach cell `(i, j)` from the start `(1, 1)`. We will iterate over the grid, and for each cell, we will calculate the number of ways to reach it by summing the number of ways to reach the cell to the left `(i, j-1)` and the cell above `(i-1, j)`, taking into account the presence of rocks and the pushing mechanism.\n\nThe key to solving this problem is to handle the rocks correctly. When we encounter a rock, we need to check if pushing it is legal (i.e., it does not go outside the labyrinth) and update the DP table accordingly.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Unique Paths in a Grid**: Given a grid with obstacles, count the number of unique paths from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner. You can only move right or down. This problem can be solved using a similar DP approach, where the presence of an obstacle in a cell means there are 0 ways to reach that cell.\n\n2. **Minimum Path Sum**: Given a grid filled with non-negative numbers, find a path from the top left to the bottom right which minimizes the sum of all numbers along its path. This problem can be solved using DP by keeping a table that stores the minimum sum to reach each cell.\n\n3. **Longest Increasing Path in a Matrix**: Given an integer matrix, find the length of the longest increasing path. From each cell, you can either move in four directions: left, right, up, or down. This problem can be solved using DP with memoization, where each cell in the DP table represents the length of the longest increasing path starting from that cell.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\nWe will create a 2D DP table `dp` with dimensions `n x m`.

If a cell contains a rock, we will check if pushing the rock is legal and update the DP table accordingly.

The algorithm involves the following steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total duration of all videos.\n2. Check if the total duration is divisible by `k` to ensure that it's possible to divide the videos into `k` posts with equal total duration.\n3. Use a prefix sum array to find the points where the videos can be split to form the posts.\n\n## Tutorial:\nPrefix sums are a common technique used in competitive programming to calculate the sum of elements in a subarray quickly. The prefix sum array is an array where each element at index `i` stores the sum of elements from the start of the array up to index `i`. This allows us to calculate the sum of any subarray in constant time by subtracting the prefix sum at the start of the subarray from the prefix sum at the end of the subarray.\n\nTo solve this problem using prefix sums, we first calculate the total duration of all videos. If this total is not divisible by `k`, it's impossible to split the videos into `k` posts with equal durations, and we output \"No\". If it is divisible, we calculate the target duration for each post by dividing the total duration by `k`.\n\nNext, we iterate through the videos, keeping a running sum of durations. Whenever the running sum equals the target duration, we note that index as a split point for a post. We continue this process until we have found `k-1` split points (the last post will contain the remaining videos).\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Equal Sum Partitions**: Given an array of integers, determine if it can be partitioned into `k` non-empty subsets such that the sum of elements in each subset is equal.\n   Solution: Similar to the original problem, we use the total sum and prefix sums to determine if such partitions are possible.\n\n2. **Subarray Sum Equals K**: Given an array of integers and an integer `k`, find the total number of continuous subarrays whose sum equals to `k`.\n   Solution: We can use a hashmap to store the prefix sums and their frequencies, and for each prefix sum, we check if there is a previous prefix sum that equals the current prefix sum minus `k`.\n\n3. **Maximum Subarray**: Given an integer array `nums`, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.\n   Solution: This problem can be solved using Kadane's algorithm, which is a dynamic programming approach. It involves iterating through the array and at each step, updating the maximum subarray sum found so far.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n```python\ndef find_posts(n, k, durations):\n    total_duration = sum(durations)\n    if total_duration % k != 0:\n        return \"No\", []\n    \n    target_duration = total_duration // k\n    current_sum = 0\n    posts = []\n    count = 0\n    \n    for duration in durations:\n        current_sum += duration\n        if current_sum == target_duration:\n            posts.append(count + 1)\n            current_sum = 0\n            count = 0\n        else:\n            count += 1\n    \n    if len(posts) == k:\n        return \"Yes\", posts\n    else:\n        return \"No\", []\n\n# Read input from standard input\nn, k = map(int, input().split())\ndurations = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n# Solve the problem\nresult, posts = find_posts(n, k, durations)\n\n# Print output to standard output\nprint(result)\nif result == \"Yes\":\n    print(*posts)\n```\n\nThis code reads the input, calls the `find_posts` function to determine if a solution exists, and then prints the result to the standard output. If a solution exists, it prints \"Yes\" followed by the values of `s_1, s_2, ..., s_k`. If no solution exists, it prints \"No\"."], "prompt_tokens": [915], "completion_tokens": [829], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": true, "language": "Python3", "task_id": 2160}

The problem requires us to find a set of simple cycles (cycles that do not repeat vertices) that cover each edge exactly twice. This is a specific case of the more general graph covering problem.\n\n## Tutorial:\nIn graph theory, a cycle cover of a graph is a collection of cycles such that each edge of the graph is included in at least one cycle. If each edge must be covered exactly twice, we are dealing with a double cycle cover. For complete graphs, there are specific patterns and properties that can be used to construct such covers.\n\nFor a complete graph with n vertices (denoted as K_n), we can use the following observations:\n- If n is odd, we can cover the graph with cycles of length 3 (triangles). This is because a complete graph with an odd number of vertices can be decomposed into (n-1)/2 edge-disjoint Hamiltonian paths, and each path can be paired with its reverse to form a double cycle cover with triangles.\n- If n is even, we need to use cycles of length 4 (quadrangles) as well, because it's not possible to cover all edges with only triangles without repeating an edge.\n\nThe construction of these cycles can be done using specific patterns that ensure each edge is covered exactly twice.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. Hamiltonian Cycle Problem: Given a graph, determine whether it contains a Hamiltonian cycle (a cycle that visits each vertex exactly once). The solution involves backtracking and trying different paths until a Hamiltonian cycle is found or all possibilities are exhausted.\n\n2. Edge Coloring Problem: Given a graph, assign colors to the edges such that no two adjacent edges have the same color. The solution can involve greedy algorithms or more complex methods like Vizing's Theorem.\n\n3. Eulerian Circuit Problem: Given a graph, determine whether it contains an Eulerian circuit (a cycle that visits each edge exactly once). The solution involves checking if all vertices have even degree and then finding the circuit using Fleury's algorithm or Hierholzer's algorithm.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\nFor odd n, we can create a double cycle cover using triangles by pairing each vertex with all other vertices in a systematic way. For even n, we need to use both triangles and quadrangles. The construction for even n is more complex and involves creating quadrangles that cover the edges not covered by triangles.\n\nHere is the Python3 code to solve the problem:\n\n```python\ndef solve(n):\n    if n % 2 == 1:\n        # For odd n, we can cover the graph with triangles.\n        print((n * (n - 1)) // 2)\n        for i in range(1, n + 1):\n            for j in range(i + 1, n + 1):\n                print(3, i, j, n if i + j == n + 1 else ((i + j - 1) % n))\n    else:\n        # For even n, we need to use both triangles and quadrangles.\n        print(n * (n - 1))\n        for i in range(1, n):\n            for j in range(i + 1, n + 1):\n                if (i + j) % n == 1:\n                    print(4, i, j, i % n + 1, (j % n + 1) % n + 1)\n                else:\n                    print(3, i, j, n if i + j == n + 1 else ((i + j - 1) % n))\n\n# Read input and solve the problem\nn = int(input())\nsolve(n)\n```\n\nThis code first checks if n is odd or even and then prints the cycles according to the patterns described above.

Binary search is used to find the minimum possible processing time, and the greedy approach is used to verify if a given processing time is achievable by grouping the photos.\n\n## Tutorial:\n**Binary Search** is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array. It compares the target value to the middle element of the array; if they are not equal, the half in which the target cannot lie is eliminated, and the search continues on the remaining half until the target is found or the remaining half is empty.\n\nIn this problem, we are not searching for a specific value in an array, but rather we are searching for the minimum processing time within a range of possible values (from 0 to the maximum contrast difference). We can use binary search because if a certain processing time is possible, any larger processing time is also possible, which means the condition is monotonic.\n\nThe **Greedy Approach** is used to check if a given processing time is possible. We iterate through the sorted contrasts and group them such that the difference between the maximum and minimum contrasts in each group is less than or equal to the processing time we are checking. If we can create enough groups (at least `k` photos per group), then the processing time is possible.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Aggressive cows**: Given the positions of cow stalls and a number of cows, find the largest minimum distance between cows. The solution involves binary searching the answer for the minimum distance and using a greedy approach to place cows in stalls.\n\n2. **Allocate minimum number of pages**: Given an array of pages in `n` books and `k` students, allocate books to students such that the maximum number of pages assigned to a student is minimized. Binary search is used on the range of possible maximum pages, and a greedy approach checks the feasibility.\n\n3. **Koko Eating Bananas**: Koko can decide to eat bananas at a certain rate and wants to finish all bananas within `h` hours. Find the minimum integer `k` such that she can eat all the bananas within `h` hours. Binary search is used to find the minimum `k`, and a greedy approach checks if Koko can finish with a particular `k`.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n```python\ndef is_possible(contrasts, n, k, max_processing_time):\n    groups = 1\n    min_contrast = contrasts[0]\n    max_contrast = contrasts[0]\n    \n    for i in range(1, n):\n        max_contrast = max(max_contrast, contrasts[i])\n        if max_contrast - min_contrast > max_processing_time:\n            groups += 1\n            min_contrast = max_contrast = contrasts[i]\n            if groups > n // k:\n                return False\n    return True\n\ndef find_min_processing_time(contrasts, n, k):\n    contrasts.sort()\n    left, right = 0, contrasts[-1] - contrasts[0]\n    result = right\n    \n    while left <= right:\n        mid = (left + right) // 2\n        if is_possible(contrasts, n, k, mid):\n            result = mid\n            right = mid - 1\n        else:\n            left = mid + 1\n    return result\n\n# Read input from standard input\nn, k = map(int, input().split())\ncontrasts = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n# Solve the problem and print the result to standard output\nprint(find_min_processing_time(contrasts, n, k))\n```\n\nThis code first reads the input, sorts the contrast values, and then uses binary search to find the minimum processing time.
