The key is to sort the list first to ensure that the closest elements are adjacent to each other, which makes the comparison process efficient.\n\n## Tutorial:\nTo solve problems like this, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Sort the list of numbers. Sorting brings elements closer to their nearest neighbors in the list, which is essential for this problem.\n2. Iterate through the sorted list and compare the absolute difference between each pair of adjacent elements.\n3. If the absolute difference is less than the given threshold, return `True` because you have found two elements that are closer to each other than the threshold.\n4. If you reach the end of the list without finding such a pair, return `False`.\n\nThis approach has a time complexity of O(n log n) due to the sorting step, where n is the number of elements in the list. The iteration step has a time complexity of O(n), but since sorting is more expensive, it dominates the overall time complexity.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Closest Pair of Points Problem**: Given a set of points on a plane, find the pair of points with the smallest distance between them. The solution involves sorting the points according to their x-coordinates and then using a divide-and-conquer approach to find the minimum distance.\n\n2. **Find the Duplicate Number**: Given an array of integers containing `n + 1` integers where each integer is between 1 and n (inclusive), prove that at least one duplicate number must exist. The challenge is to find the duplicate number using O(1) extra space and in O(n) time. A solution involves the Floyd's Tortoise and Hare (Cycle Detection) algorithm.\n\n3. **Three Sum Problem**: Given an array of n integers, are there elements a, b, c in the array such that a + b + c = 0? Find all unique triplets in the array which gives the sum of zero.

A stack is a collection of elements that supports two principal operations: push, which adds an element to the collection, and pop, which removes the most recently added element. The stack follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle.\n\n## Tutorial:\nStacks are often used in algorithms that need to keep track of elements in a way that the last element added is the first one to be removed. This is particularly useful in parsing and evaluating expressions with nested structures, such as arithmetic expressions or nested parentheses.\n\nWhen dealing with nested parentheses, a stack can help keep track of the opening and closing pairs. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to use a stack for this purpose:\n\n1. Initialize an empty stack.\n2. Iterate over each character in the input string.\n3. If the character is an opening parenthesis, push it onto the stack.\n4. If the character is a closing parenthesis, pop an element from the stack (which should be the matching opening parenthesis) and check for balance.\n5. If at any point the stack is empty when we encounter a closing parenthesis, or there are elements left in the stack after processing the entire string, the parentheses are not balanced.\n6. To separate groups of parentheses, we can keep a counter of the current depth (increment when pushing, decrement when popping) and extract substrings when the depth returns to zero.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Valid Parentheses**: Given a string containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid. An input string is valid if:\n   - Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.\n   - Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.\n   Solution: Use a stack to keep track of opening brackets and ensure they are closed correctly.\n\n2. **Longest Valid Parentheses**: Given a string containing just the characters '(' and ')', find the length of the longest valid (well-formed) parentheses substring.\n   Solution: Use a stack to keep track of indices of parentheses and calculate the length of valid substrings.\n\n3. **Generate Parentheses**: Given n pairs of parentheses, write a function to generate all combinations of well-formed parentheses.\n   Solution: Use a backtracking approach with a stack to ensure that the generated parentheses are balanced.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\nThe solution involves using a stack to keep track of the depth of nested parentheses. We iterate through the string, ignoring spaces, and for each parenthesis, we perform the following actions:\n- If it's an opening parenthesis, we push it onto the stack and start a new substring if the stack was previously empty.\n- If it's a closing parenthesis, we pop from the stack and close the current substring if the stack becomes empty after popping.\n\nHere's the Python code:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef separate_paren_groups(paren_string: str) -> List[str]:\n    stack = []\n    result = []\n    current_group = \"\"\n    \n    for char in paren_string:\n        if char == ' ':\n            continue\n        if char == '(':\n            if not stack:\n                # Start a new group if the stack was empty\n                current_group = \"\"\n            stack.append(char)\n            current_group += char\n        elif char == ')':\n            stack.pop()\n            current_group += char\n            if not stack:\n                # Group is complete if the stack is empty\n                result.append(current_group)\n    \n    return result\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(separate_paren_groups('( ) (( )) (( )( ))'))  # Output: ['()', '(())', '(()())']\n```\n\nThis code will correctly separate the groups of nested parentheses and return them as a list of strings."], "prompt_tokens": [279], "completion_tokens": [781], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": false, "language": "Python3"}

This can be achieved using basic arithmetic operations and the built-in functions of Python.\n\n## Tutorial:\nIn Python, floating-point numbers can be decomposed into their integer and decimal parts using a combination of floor division and modulo operations, or by using built-in functions such as `int()` for obtaining the integer part and `math.modf()` for separating the integer and decimal parts.\n\nHere's a brief explanation of the methods:\n\n1. **Floor Division (`//`)**: This operation divides the number and returns the largest integer less than or equal to the result. For example, `5.7 // 1` would return `5.0`.\n\n2. **Modulo Operation (`%`)**: This operation returns the remainder of the division of the number by another number. For example, `5.7 % 1` would return `0.7`, which is the decimal part of the number.\n\n3. **`int()` Function**: This function can be used to convert a floating-point number to an integer, effectively truncating the decimal part. For example, `int(5.7)` would return `5`.\n\n4. **`math.modf()` Function**: This function from the `math` module splits the number into the integer and fractional parts. It returns a tuple where the first element is the fractional part and the second is the integer part. For example, `math.modf(5.7)` would return `(0.7, 5.0)`.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Rounding Numbers**: Given a floating-point number, round it to the nearest integer. If the decimal part is 0.5 or higher, round up; otherwise, round down.\n\n   Solution: Use the built-in `round()` function to round the number. If you need to implement it manually, check the decimal part. If it's 0.5 or more, add 1 to the integer part.\n\n   ```python\n   def round_number(num):\n       decimal_part = num % 1\n       integer_part = int(num)\n       return integer_part + (1 if decimal_part >= 0.5 else 0)\n   ```\n\n2. **Fractional Knapsack Problem**: Given weights and values of `n` items, we need to put these items in a knapsack of capacity `W` to get the maximum total value in the knapsack. Unlike the 0/1 Knapsack problem, items can be broken into smaller pieces.\n\n   Solution: Sort the items by their value-to-weight ratio. Then, iterate over the sorted items, adding as much of each item as possible until the knapsack is full.\n\n   ```python\n   def fractional_knapsack(value, weight, capacity):\n       index = list(range(len(value)))\n       ratio = [v/w for v, w in zip(value, weight)]\n       index.sort(key=lambda i: ratio[i], reverse=True)\n       max_value = 0\n       for i in index:\n           if weight[i] <= capacity:\n               max_value += value[i]\n               capacity -= weight[i]\n           else:\n               max_value += value[i] * (capacity / weight[i])\n               break\n       return max_value\n   ```\n\n3. **Finding the Square Root**: Given a non-negative number `x`, find its square root with a precision of `epsilon`.\n\n   Solution: Use a numerical method such as the Newton-Raphson method to iteratively find the square root.\n\n   ```python\n   def square_root(x, epsilon=1e-10):\n       r = x\n       while abs(x - r * r) > epsilon:\n           r = (r + x / r) / 2\n       return r\n   ```\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\nTo solve the original problem, we can simply use the modulo operation to obtain the decimal part of the number.

The difference is that standard deviation squares the differences before averaging them, and takes the square root of the average at the end.\n   \n2. **Weighted Mean Absolute Deviation**: This is a variation of MAD where each absolute difference is multiplied by a weight before averaging. This is used when some data points are more important than others.\n\n3. **Outlier Detection**: MAD can be used to detect outliers in a dataset. A common approach is to consider points that are more than \\( k \\) times the MAD away from the mean as outliers.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\nTo solve the original problem, we will implement the steps outlined in the tutorial. We will first calculate the mean of the input numbers. Then, we will compute the absolute difference between each number and the mean. Finally, we will calculate the average of these absolute differences to find the MAD.\n\nHere is the Python3 code to solve the problem:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:\n    # Calculate the mean of the numbers\n    mean = sum(numbers) / len(numbers)\n    \n    # Calculate the absolute differences from the mean\n    absolute_differences = [abs(x - mean) for x in numbers]\n    \n    # Calculate the mean of the absolute differences (MAD)\n    mad = sum(absolute_differences) / len(numbers)\n    \n    return mad\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(mean_absolute_deviation([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]))  # Output: 1.0\n```\n\nThis code will correctly calculate the Mean Absolute Deviation for a given list of numbers."], "prompt_tokens": [281], "completion_tokens": [618], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": false, "language": "Python3"}

Here are some basic operations that are often used in list manipulation:\n\n- **Appending**: Adding an element to the end of the list using `append()` method.\n- **Inserting**: Inserting an element at a specific position using `insert()` method.\n- **Slicing**: Accessing a subset of the list using slice notation `[start:stop:step]`.\n- **Iterating**: Going through each element of the list using a loop (e.g., `for` loop).\n\nFor the given problem, we can use a simple `for` loop to iterate through the input list and append elements to a new list, interspersing the delimiter as we go. We need to handle the edge case where the input list is empty, in which case we simply return an empty list.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Merge Two Sorted Lists**: Given two sorted lists, merge them into a single sorted list. This involves iterating through both lists and choosing the smaller element at each step to add to the new list.\n\n2. **Zero Padding**: Given a list of numbers and a target length, pad the list with zeros until it reaches the target length. This requires appending zeros to the list until its length is equal to the target length.\n\n3. **Rotate List**: Given a list and a number `k`, rotate the list to the right by `k` places.

The algorithm involves iterating through each character in the input string and using a stack or a counter to keep track of the current level of nesting. When an opening parenthesis is encountered, the nesting level increases, and when a closing parenthesis is encountered, the nesting level decreases. The maximum nesting level encountered during this process is recorded for each group of parentheses.\n\n## Tutorial:\nStack-based parsing is a common technique used to process strings with nested structures, such as mathematical expressions, programming code, and, in this case, nested parentheses. The stack is an abstract data type that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. It has two primary operations: push (add an item) and pop (remove the most recently added item).\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide to parsing nested parentheses using a stack or a counter:\n\n1. Initialize a counter to zero. This counter will keep track of the current level of nesting.\n2. Initialize a variable to keep track of the maximum nesting level encountered.\n3. Iterate through each character in the string.\n4. If an opening parenthesis '(' is encountered, increment the counter by one.\n5. If a closing parenthesis ')' is encountered, check if the counter is greater than the maximum nesting level. If so, update the maximum nesting level. Then, decrement the counter by one.\n6. After processing all characters in a group, record the maximum nesting level for that group.\n7. Reset the counter and maximum nesting level variables before processing the next group.\n8. Repeat steps 3-7 for each group of parentheses.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Valid Parentheses**: Given a string containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid. An input string is valid if the brackets are closed in the correct order.\n   - Solution: Use a stack to keep track of opening brackets. When a closing bracket is encountered, check if it matches the top of the stack. If it does, pop the stack; otherwise, the string is invalid.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def isValid(s: str) -> bool:\n         stack = []\n         mapping = {')': '(', '}': '{', ']': '['}\n         for char in s:\n             if char in mapping:\n                 top_element = stack.pop() if stack else '#'\n                 if mapping[char] != top_element:\n                     return False\n             else:\n                 stack.append(char)\n         return not stack\n     ```\n\n2. **Longest Valid Parentheses**: Given a string containing just the characters '(' and ')', find the length of the longest valid (well-formed) parentheses substring.\n   - Solution: Use a stack to keep track of indices of '(' characters. When a ')' is encountered, pop the stack and calculate the length of the valid substring.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def longestValidParentheses(s: str) -> int:\n         stack = [-1]\n         max_length = 0\n         for i, char in enumerate(s):\n             if char == '(':\n                 stack.append(i)\n             else:\n                 stack.pop()\n                 if not stack:\n                     stack.append(i)\n                 else:\n                     max_length = max(max_length, i - stack[-1])\n         return max_length\n     ```\n\n3. **Generate Parentheses**: Given n pairs of parentheses, write a function to generate all combinations of well-formed parentheses.\n   - Solution: Use backtracking to generate all possible combinations and validate them using a stack or a counter.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def generateParenthesis(n: int) -> List[str]:\n         def backtrack(S='', left=0, right=0):\n             if len(S) == 2 * n:\n                 ans.append(S)\n                 return\n             if left < n:\n                 backtrack(S + '(', left + 1, right)\n             if right < left:\n                 backtrack(S + ')', left, right + 1)\n         \n         ans = []\n         backtrack()\n         return ans\n     ```\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n- Explanation of the solution:\n  The solution involves iterating through each group of parentheses in the input string, using a counter to track the current level of nesting, and updating the maximum nesting level for each group.

The task is to iterate through a list of strings and check if each string contains a specific substring.\n\n## Tutorial:\nString searching is a common task in programming where you need to find occurrences of a substring within a string. Python provides several methods to perform string searching:\n\n1. `in` operator: You can use the `in` operator to check if a substring exists within a string. It returns `True` if the substring is found, otherwise `False`.\n\n```python\nif \"sub\" in \"substring\":\n    print(\"Substring found!\")\n```\n\n2. `str.find()`: This method returns the lowest index in the string where the substring is found. If the substring is not found, it returns `-1`.\n\n```python\nindex = \"substring\".find(\"sub\")\nif index != -1:\n    print(\"Substring found at index\", index)\n```\n\n3. `str.index()`: Similar to `str.find()`, but it raises a `ValueError` if the substring is not found.\n\n```python\ntry:\n    index = \"substring\".index(\"sub\")\n    print(\"Substring found at index\", index)\nexcept ValueError:\n    print(\"Substring not found\")\n```\n\n4. `str.count()`: This method returns the number of non-overlapping occurrences of the substring in the string.\n\n```python\ncount = \"substring\".count(\"sub\")\nprint(\"Substring found\", count, \"times\")\n```\n\nWhen filtering a list of strings by a substring, you typically iterate through the list and use one of the above methods to check each string for the presence of the substring.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Counting Substrings**: Given a string and a substring, count how many times the substring occurs in the string.\n   Solution: Use the `str.count()` method to find the number of occurrences.\n   ```python\n   def count_substrings(s: str, sub: str) -> int:\n       return s.count(sub)\n   ```\n\n2. **Finding All Substring Occurrences**: Given a string and a substring, find all the starting indices where the substring is found in the string.\n   Solution: Iterate through the string and use `str.find()` or `in` operator to check for the substring, updating the index each time you find an occurrence.\n   ```python\n   def find_all_substrings(s: str, sub: str) -> List[int]:\n       indices = []\n       index = s.find(sub)\n       while index != -1:\n           indices.append(index)\n           index = s.find(sub, index + 1)\n       return indices\n   ```\n\n3. **Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters**: Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.\n   Solution: Use a sliding window approach to maintain a set of characters currently in the window and expand or shrink the window as you iterate through the string.\n   ```python\n   def length_of_longest_substring(s: str) -> int:\n       char_set = set()\n       left = 0\n       max_length = 0\n       for right in range(len(s)):\n           while s[right] in char_set:\n               char_set.remove(s[left])\n               left += 1\n           char_set.add(s[right])\n           max_length = max(max_length, right - left + 1)\n       return max_length\n   ```\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\nThe solution involves iterating through the list of strings and using the `in` operator to check if the substring is present in each string.

This is a straightforward approach that does not require any advanced algorithms or data structures. However, in more complex variations of this problem, one might use a data structure called a \"monotonic queue\" to efficiently find the rolling maximum over a fixed-size sliding window.\n\n## Tutorial:\nFor the simple rolling maximum problem, the algorithm is as follows:\n\n1. Initialize a variable to keep track of the current maximum value. This can be set to the first element of the list or negative infinity if the list can contain negative numbers.\n2. Iterate through each element in the list.\n3. Update the current maximum value if the current element is greater than the current maximum.\n4. Append the current maximum value to the result list.\n5. Return the result list after the iteration is complete.\n\nFor a fixed-size sliding window rolling maximum problem, a monotonic queue can be used. A monotonic queue is a data structure that maintains elements in a sorted order, such that the maximum (or minimum) element can be queried in constant time. When a new element is added, all elements smaller than the new element are removed from the queue, as they will no longer be needed for future maximum queries.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Sliding Window Maximum**: Given an array of integers and a number k, find the maximum value in each sliding window of size k. This problem can be solved using a monotonic queue to efficiently keep track of the maximum in the current window.\n\n2. **Maximum of All Subarrays of Size K**: Similar to the sliding window maximum, but instead of a sliding window, you are asked to find the maximum for all contiguous subarrays of size k. This can also be solved using a monotonic queue.\n\n3. **Maximum of Minimum for Every Window Size**: Given an array of integers, find the maximum of the minimum of every window size from 1 to the size of the array.

You compare the string with its reverse. If they are the same, it's a palindrome.\n\n2. **Finding the Longest Palindromic Suffix**: You need to find the longest substring at the end of the given string that is a palindrome. This can be done by checking progressively smaller suffixes of the string until you find a palindrome.\n\n3. **Appending the Reverse Prefix**: Once the longest palindromic suffix is found, the remaining prefix (the part of the string not included in the suffix) is reversed and appended to the end of the original string to create the shortest palindrome.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Longest Palindromic Substring**: Given a string `s`, find the longest palindromic substring in `s`. The solution involves dynamic programming or expanding around the center to check for palindromes.\n\n2. **Palindrome Partitioning**: Given a string `s`, partition `s` such that every substring of the partition is a palindrome.

As a result, we can use the following steps to find the GCD of two numbers `a` and `b`:\n\n1. If `b` equals 0, then the GCD is `a`.

No complex algorithms are needed for this task. The idea is to iterate over the string and at each step, slice the string from the beginning up to the current position to create a prefix.\n\n## Tutorial:\nString slicing in Python allows you to extract a substring from a given string. The syntax for slicing is `string[start:stop]`, where `start` is the index where the slice starts (inclusive), and `stop` is the index where the slice ends (exclusive). If `start` is omitted, it defaults to 0, and if `stop` is omitted, it defaults to the length of the string.\n\nTo generate all prefixes of a string, you can use a loop that goes from 1 to the length of the string (inclusive). At each iteration, you slice the string from the start up to the current loop index. This will give you all the prefixes from the shortest to the longest.\n\nHere's a step-by-step example with the string `'abc'`:\n- Loop index 1: slice `'abc'[0:1]` which gives `'a'`\n- Loop index 2: slice `'abc'[0:2]` which gives `'ab'`\n- Loop index 3: slice `'abc'[0:3]` which gives `'abc'`\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Longest Common Prefix**: Given a list of strings, find the longest common prefix among them.\n   - Solution: Iterate over the strings character by character and compare the characters at the current position for all strings. Stop when a mismatch is found.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def longest_common_prefix(strs):\n         if not strs:\n             return \"\"\n         shortest = min(strs, key=len)\n         for i, char in enumerate(shortest):\n             for other in strs:\n                 if other[i] != char:\n                     return shortest[:i]\n         return shortest\n     ```\n\n2. **Substring with Concatenation of All Words**: You are given a string and a list of words, find all the starting indices of substring(s) in the given string that is a concatenation of each word in the list exactly once and without any intervening characters.\n   - Solution: Use a sliding window approach to check for the presence of all words in each substring of the appropriate length.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def findSubstring(s, words):\n         from collections import Counter\n         word_len = len(words[0])\n         num_words = len(words)\n         total_len = word_len * num_words\n         word_count = Counter(words)\n         indices = []\n         \n         for i in range(len(s) - total_len + 1):\n             seen = Counter()\n             for j in range(i, i + total_len, word_len):\n                 curr_word = s[j:j + word_len]\n                 if curr_word in word_count:\n                     seen[curr_word] += 1\n                     if seen[curr_word] > word_count[curr_word]:\n                         break\n                 else:\n                     break\n             if seen == word_count:\n                 indices.append(i)\n         return indices\n     ```\n\n3. **Palindrome Partitioning**: Given a string, partition it such that every substring of the partition is a palindrome. Return all possible palindrome partitioning of the string.\n   - Solution: Use backtracking to generate all possible partitions and check if each partition is a palindrome.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def partition(s):\n         def is_palindrome(s):\n             return s == s[::-1]\n         \n         def backtrack(start, path):\n             if start == len(s):\n                 result.append(path[:])\n                 return\n             for end in range(start + 1, len(s) + 1):\n                 if is_palindrome(s[start:end]):\n                     backtrack(end, path + [s[start:end]])\n         \n         result = []\n         backtrack(0, [])\n         return result\n     ```\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n- Explanation of the solution:\n  The solution involves iterating over the string with a loop that goes from 1 to the length of the string (inclusive).

In competitive programming, pattern searching is a frequent challenge, where you need to find occurrences of a pattern (substring) within a larger string.\n\nThe sliding window technique is a method to create a window over the data and slide it to check for certain conditions or compute something within the window. For string pattern searching, the window size is typically the length of the pattern we are searching for. We slide the window one character at a time and compare the window with the pattern.\n\nTo count overlapping occurrences, we do not jump the window by the length of the pattern after a match (as we would do to find non-overlapping occurrences). Instead, we move the window by one character regardless of whether the current window matches the pattern or not.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Problem: Find All Anagrams in a String**\n   - Description: Given a string `s` and a non-empty string `p`, find all the start indices of `p`'s anagrams in `s`.\n   - Solution: Use a sliding window to go through `s` with the window size equal to the length of `p`. Use a hash map to count the characters in `p` and compare it with the current window in `s`. If the counts match, it's an anagram.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     from collections import Counter\n\n     def findAnagrams(s: str, p: str) -> List[int]:\n         p_count = Counter(p)\n         s_count = Counter()\n         result = []\n         for i in range(len(s)):\n             s_count[s[i]] += 1\n             if i >= len(p):\n                 if s_count[s[i - len(p)]] == 1:\n                     del s_count[s[i - len(p)]]\n                 else:\n                     s_count[s[i - len(p)]] -= 1\n             if s_count == p_count:\n                 result.append(i - len(p) + 1)\n         return result\n     ```\n\n2. **Problem: Implement strStr()**\n   - Description: Return the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack, or -1 if needle is not part of haystack.\n   - Solution: Use a sliding window to scan through `haystack` with the window size equal to the length of `needle`. Compare each window with `needle`.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def strStr(haystack: str, needle: str) -> int:\n         if not needle:\n             return 0\n         for i in range(len(haystack) - len(needle) + 1):\n             if haystack[i:i+len(needle)] == needle:\n                 return i\n         return -1\n     ```\n\n3. **Problem: Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters**\n   - Description: Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.\n   - Solution: Use a sliding window to expand and contract as you find repeating characters. Use a set to keep track of characters in the current window.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def lengthOfLongestSubstring(s: str) -> int:\n         char_set = set()\n         left = 0\n         result = 0\n         for right in range(len(s)):\n             while s[right] in char_set:\n                 char_set.remove(s[left])\n                 left += 1\n             char_set.add(s[right])\n             result = max(result, right - left + 1)\n         return result\n     ```\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n- Explanation of the solution:\n  We will iterate through the original string with a sliding window of the size of the substring. For each position, we will compare the substring with the part of the string inside the window. If they match, we increment our count. We continue this process until we reach the end of the string.\n\n- Python3 code:\n  ```python\n  def how_many_times(string: str, substring: str) -> int:\n      count = 0\n      sub_len = len(substring)\n      for i in range(len(string) - sub_len + 1):\n          if string[i:i+sub_len] == substring:\n              count += 1\n      return count\n\n  # Example usage:\n  print(how_many_times('', 'a'))  # Output: 0\n  print(how_many_times('aaa', 'a'))  # Output: 3\n  print(how_many_times('aaaa', 'aa'))  # Output: 3\n  ```"], "prompt_tokens": [252], "completion_tokens": [1019], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": false, "language": "Python3"}

Sorting is a fundamental algorithmic problem in computer science, where the goal is to rearrange the elements of a list (or array) in a certain order, typically ascending or descending. In this specific problem, we are dealing with sorting strings that represent numbers in their word form.\n\n## Tutorial:\nSorting algorithms are numerous and varied, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. Some of the most commonly used sorting algorithms include:\n\n1. **Bubble Sort**: A simple comparison-based algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted.\n\n2. **Selection Sort**: This algorithm divides the input list into two parts: a sorted sublist of items which is built up from left to right at the front of the list, and a sublist of the remaining unsorted items. The algorithm proceeds by finding the smallest (or largest, depending on sorting order) element in the unsorted sublist, exchanging it with the leftmost unsorted element, and moving the sublist boundaries one element to the right.\n\n3. **Insertion Sort**: It builds the final sorted array one item at a time. It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort.\n\n4. **Merge Sort**: A divide and conquer algorithm that divides the input array into two halves, calls itself for the two halves, and then merges the two sorted halves.\n\n5. **Quicksort**: Another divide and conquer algorithm. It picks an element as a pivot and partitions the given array around the picked pivot.\n\nFor this problem, since we are dealing with a predefined small set of strings (number words), we can use a custom sorting strategy that maps each word to its corresponding numeric value, sorts the numeric values, and then maps back to the word form.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Sorting a list of strings based on custom rules**: For example, sorting a list of strings based on their length, and if two strings have the same length, sorting them alphabetically.\n\n2. **Sorting a list of tuples based on the second element**: Given a list of tuples, sort them based on the second value of the tuple.\n\n3. **Sorting a list of objects based on an attribute**: Given a list of objects (e.g., students with attributes like name, age, and grade), sort the objects based on a specific attribute, such as grade.\n\nFor each of these problems, the solution would involve defining a custom key function that is passed to the `sorted()` function or the `.sort()` method in Python, which then sorts the list based on the custom criteria defined in the key function.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\n- Create a mapping of number words to their numeric values.\n- Split the input string into a list of number words.\n- Sort the list of number words using the numeric values as keys.\n- Join the sorted list of number words back into a single string.\n\n```python\ndef sort_numbers(numbers: str) -> str:\n    # Mapping of number words to their numeric values\n    number_map = {\n        'zero': 0, 'one': 1, 'two': 2, 'three': 3, 'four': 4,\n        'five': 5, 'six': 6, 'seven': 7, 'eight': 8, 'nine': 9\n    }\n    \n    # Split the input string into a list of number words\n    words = numbers.split()\n    \n    # Sort the list of number words using the numeric values as keys\n    sorted_words = sorted(words, key=lambda word: number_map[word])\n    \n    # Join the sorted list of number words back into a single string\n    return ' '.join(sorted_words)\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(sort_numbers('three one five'))  # Output: 'one three five'\n```\n\nThis code will correctly sort the input string of number words from smallest to largest based on their numeric value."], "prompt_tokens": [269], "completion_tokens": [839], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": true, "language": "Python3"}

The iteration step has a time complexity of O(n), but since sorting dominates, the overall time complexity remains O(n log n).\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Two Sum Closest**: Given an array of integers and a target value, find two integers in the array such that their sum is closest to the target value.

The `isinstance()` function is commonly used to ensure that variables are of the expected type before performing operations on them.\n\nHere's a quick tutorial on how to use `isinstance()`:\n\n```python\nx = 10\ny = \"Hello\"\n\n# Check if x is an integer\nif isinstance(x, int):\n    print(\"x is an integer\")\n\n# Check if y is a string\nif isinstance(y, str):\n    print(\"y is a string\")\n```\n\nIn the context of filtering a list, you would use `isinstance()` in a list comprehension or a loop to check each element and only include those that are integers.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Filtering Specific Types**: Given a list of mixed data types, write a function to filter out all elements that are not of type float.\n   \n   Solution: Use `isinstance()` in a list comprehension to include only elements of type `float`.\n\n   ```python\n   def filter_floats(values):\n       return [x for x in values if isinstance(x, float)]\n   ```\n\n2. **Type-Specific Operations**: Given a list of mixed data types, write a function to calculate the sum of all integer elements.\n\n   Solution: Iterate through the list, check if an element is an integer using `isinstance()`, and add it to a running total if it is.\n\n   ```python\n   def sum_integers(values):\n       total = 0\n       for x in values:\n           if isinstance(x, int):\n               total += x\n       return total\n   ```\n\n3. **Class Filtering**: In an object-oriented program, given a list of objects of different classes, write a function to filter out all objects that are not instances of a given class.\n\n   Solution: Use `isinstance()` to check if each object is an instance of the specified class and filter accordingly.\n\n   ```python\n   def filter_class(objects, cls):\n       return [obj for obj in objects if isinstance(obj, cls)]\n   ```\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\nThe solution involves iterating over the list of values and using `isinstance()` to check if each value is an integer. If it is, the value is included in the output list.\n\nHere's the Python3 code:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List, Any\n\ndef filter_integers(values: List[Any]) -> List[int]:\n    \"\"\" Filter given list of any python values only for integers \"\"\"\n    return [x for x in values if isinstance(x, int)]\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(filter_integers(['a', 3.14, 5]))  # Output: [5]\n    print(filter_integers([1, 2, 3, 'abc', {}, []]))  # Output: [1, 2, 3]\n```\n\nThis code uses a list comprehension to create a new list that contains only the elements from the original list that are integers. The `isinstance()` function is used to perform the type check."], "prompt_tokens": [255], "completion_tokens": [735], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": true, "language": "Python3"}

It simply requires understanding how to determine the length of a string in Python. The core concept here is string manipulation and understanding how strings are stored and accessed in memory.\n\n## Tutorial:\nIn Python, strings are arrays of bytes representing Unicode characters. However, Python does not have a character data type; a single character is simply a string with a length of 1. Strings are immutable, which means they cannot be changed after they are created.\n\nTo find the length of a string in Python, you can use the built-in `len()` function, which returns the number of items in an object. When the object is a string, `len()` returns the number of characters in the string.\n\nHere's a simple example:\n\n```python\nmy_string = \"Hello, World!\"\nprint(len(my_string))  # Output: 13\n```\n\nIn competitive programming, however, you might be asked to implement this functionality from scratch without using the built-in `len()` function. In such cases, you could iterate over the string and count the number of iterations to determine the string's length.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Counting the number of words in a string**: Given a string, count the number of words in it. The words are separated by spaces.\n   - Solution: Split the string by spaces and count the number of elements in the resulting list.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def count_words(string):\n         return len(string.split())\n     ```\n\n2. **Finding the longest word in a sentence**: Given a sentence, find the longest word in it.\n   - Solution: Split the sentence into words, then iterate through the words and keep track of the longest one.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def longest_word(sentence):\n         words = sentence.split()\n         longest = \"\"\n         for word in words:\n             if len(word) > len(longest):\n                 longest = word\n         return longest\n     ```\n\n3. **Palindrome Check**: Check if a given string is a palindrome (reads the same backward as forward).\n   - Solution: Compare characters from the beginning and the end of the string moving towards the center.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def is_palindrome(string):\n         left, right = 0, len(string) - 1\n         while left < right:\n             if string[left] != string[right]:\n                 return False\n             left, right = left + 1, right - 1\n         return True\n     ```\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n- Explanation of the solution:\n  The solution is straightforward. We will define a function `strlen` that takes a string as an argument and returns its length. We will manually count each character in the string using a loop and return the count.\n\n- Python3 code to solve the problem:\n  ```python\n  def strlen(string: str) -> int:\n      \"\"\" Return length of given string \"\"\"\n      count = 0\n      for char in string:\n          count += 1\n      return count\n\n  # Test cases\n  print(strlen(''))      # Output: 0\n  print(strlen('abc'))   # Output: 3\n  ```\n\nThis code defines a function that counts the number of characters in a given string by iterating through each character and incrementing a counter.

To find the largest divisor, we can iterate from `n-1` down to `1` and check if each number is a divisor of `n`.\n\n## Tutorial:\nTo find the factors of a number `n`, we can use a simple algorithm that checks each number from `1` to `n` to see if it divides `n` evenly (i.e., with a remainder of `0`).

This way, the first number we find that divides `n` evenly will be the largest divisor.\n\nHere's a step-by-step approach:\n1. Start with the number `n-1` (since `n` divided by `n` is `n`, which is not smaller than `n`).\n2. Check if `n` is divisible by this number.\n3. If it is, then this number is the largest divisor of `n`.\n4. If not, decrement the number by `1` and repeat step 2.\n5. Continue this process until you find a divisor or reach `1`.\n\nThis algorithm has a time complexity of O(n) in the worst case, as we might have to check every number from `n-1` down to `1`. However, in practice, the largest divisor is often found much sooner.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Finding the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)**: Given two numbers, find the largest number that divides both of them without leaving a remainder. The solution involves the Euclidean algorithm, which is more efficient than checking each number.\n\n2. **Prime Factorization**: Given a number `n`, find all prime factors of `n`.

For this problem, you would compare characters from the start and end of the string, flipping the case where they differ until the string becomes a palindrome.\n\n3. **Counting Case-Sensitive Substrings**: Given two strings, count how many times the second string occurs in the first string in a case-sensitive manner. For this problem, you would iterate over the first string and check for occurrences of the second string, taking into account the case of the characters.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\nThe solution involves iterating over each character in the input string and using the `swapcase()` method to flip the case of the character. The `swapcase()` method is a built-in Python string method that returns a new string with all uppercase characters converted to lowercase and vice versa.\n\nHere's the Python3 code to solve the problem:\n\n```python\ndef flip_case(string: str) -> str:\n    # Use the built-in swapcase() method to flip the case of each character\n    return string.swapcase()\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(flip_case('Hello'))  # Output: 'hELLO'\n```\n\nThis code uses the `swapcase()` method, which is a more concise and efficient way to solve the problem compared to manually checking each character's case.

String concatenation is the operation of joining character strings end-to-end. In Python, strings are immutable, which means that once a string is created, it cannot be modified. However, you can create new strings by concatenating existing strings.\n\n## Tutorial:\nString concatenation can be done in several ways in Python:\n\n1. Using the `+` operator:\n   You can concatenate two or more strings using the `+` operator.\n   ```python\n   string1 = \"Hello\"\n   string2 = \"World\"\n   concatenated_string = string1 + \" \" + string2  # \"Hello World\"\n   ```\n\n2. Using the `join()` method:\n   The `join()` method is a string method that takes an iterable (like a list or tuple) of strings and concatenates them into a single string. The string on which `join()` is called is used as the separator.\n   ```python\n   strings = [\"Hello\", \"World\"]\n   concatenated_string = \" \".join(strings)  # \"Hello World\"\n   ```\n\n3. Using f-strings (Python 3.6+):\n   F-strings provide a way to embed expressions inside string literals using curly braces `{}`.\n   ```python\n   name = \"Alice\"\n   greeting = f\"Hello, {name}!\"  # \"Hello, Alice!\"\n   ```\n\n4. Using the `%` operator or `format()` method:\n   These are older methods for formatting strings which can also be used for concatenation.\n   ```python\n   name = \"Alice\"\n   greeting = \"Hello, %s!\" % name  # \"Hello, Alice!\"\n   greeting = \"Hello, {}!\".format(name)  # \"Hello, Alice!\"\n   ```\n\nWhen concatenating a large number of strings, it is more efficient to use the `join()` method rather than the `+` operator, as the `join()` method is specifically designed for this purpose and is optimized for memory usage and performance.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Joining Words with a Hyphen**:\n   Problem: Given a list of words, concatenate them into a single string with hyphens between each word.\n   Solution: Use the `join()` method with a hyphen as the separator.\n   ```python\n   def join_with_hyphen(words: List[str]) -> str:\n       return \"-\".join(words)\n   ```\n\n2. **Creating a CSV String from a List**:\n   Problem: Given a list of values, create a comma-separated values (CSV) string.\n   Solution: Use the `join()` method with a comma as the separator.\n   ```python\n   def to_csv(values: List[str]) -> str:\n       return \",\".join(values)\n   ```\n\n3. **Reversing and Concatenating Strings**:\n   Problem: Given a list of strings, reverse each string and then concatenate them into a single string.\n   Solution: Reverse each string using slicing and then use the `join()` method.\n   ```python\n   def reverse_and_concatenate(strings: List[str]) -> str:\n       reversed_strings = [s[::-1] for s in strings]\n       return \"\".join(reversed_strings)\n   ```\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\nThe solution to the original problem is straightforward. We need to concatenate a list of strings into a single string. We can use the `join()` method with an empty string as the separator to achieve this.\n\nPython3 code to solve the problem:\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef concatenate(strings: List[str]) -> str:\n    \"\"\" Concatenate list of strings into a single string \"\"\"\n    return \"\".join(strings)\n\n# Example usage:\n# concatenate(['a', 'b', 'c']) returns 'abc'\n```\n\nThis function takes a list of strings as input and returns a single string that is the result of concatenating all the strings in the list. If the list is empty, it returns an empty string."], "prompt_tokens": [221], "completion_tokens": [838], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": false, "language": "Python3"}

In Python, strings are sequences of characters, and they come with a set of methods that make common string operations easy to perform.\n\nOne such method is `startswith()`, which is used to check if a string starts with a specified prefix.

If the string matches the condition, you can perform the necessary action, such as adding it to a result list.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Autocomplete feature**: Given a list of words and a prefix, return all words that start with that prefix. This is similar to the autocomplete feature found in search engines or IDEs.\n\n   Solution: Iterate over the list of words and use the `startswith()` method to filter out the words that match the prefix.\n\n2. **Longest Common Prefix**: Given a list of strings, find the longest common prefix among them.\n\n   Solution: Start with the first string as the longest common prefix and iteratively compare it with the next strings, shortening it until it is a prefix of all strings or is empty.\n\n3. **Directory Path Filter**: Given a list of file paths and a directory name, filter out all paths that start with the directory name.\n\n   Solution: Use the `startswith()` method to check if each path starts with the directory name and filter accordingly.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\nThe solution involves iterating over the list of strings and using the `startswith()` method to check if each string begins with the specified prefix.

List comprehension is a concise way to create lists based on existing lists. Filtering is the process of creating a new list from an existing one by including only those items that satisfy a certain condition.\n\n## Tutorial:\nList comprehension in Python allows us to generate new lists by applying an expression to each item in an existing list. The syntax for list comprehension is:\n\n```python\nnew_list = [expression for item in old_list if condition]\n```\n\nThe `condition` is like a filter that only includes the items that evaluate to `True`. If the condition is omitted, all items in the old list are included in the new list after the `expression` is applied to them.\n\nFiltering can also be done using the `filter()` function, which takes a function and a list. The function is applied to each item in the list, and only the items for which the function returns `True` are included in the new list.\n\nHere's an example of using list comprehension to filter out negative numbers from a list:\n\n```python\nnumbers = [-1, 2, -4, 5, 6]\npositive_numbers = [num for num in numbers if num > 0]\n```\n\nAnd here's an example using the `filter()` function:\n\n```python\ndef is_positive(num):\n    return num > 0\n\npositive_numbers = list(filter(is_positive, numbers))\n```\n\nBoth of these will result in `positive_numbers` being `[2, 5, 6]`.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Filtering Even Numbers**: Given a list of integers, return a list containing only the even numbers.\n   - Solution: Use list comprehension with a condition that checks if the number is even (`num % 2 == 0`).\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def get_even_numbers(numbers):\n         return [num for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0]\n     ```\n\n2. **Removing Empty Strings**: Given a list of strings, return a list with all empty strings removed.\n   - Solution: Use list comprehension with a condition that checks if the string is not empty (`str != \"\"`).\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def remove_empty_strings(strings):\n         return [str for str in strings if str]\n     ```\n\n3. **Capitalize Words**: Given a list of words, return a new list with each word capitalized.\n   - Solution: Use list comprehension with the `str.capitalize()` method applied to each word.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def capitalize_words(words):\n         return [word.capitalize() for word in words]\n     ```\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n- Explanation of the solution:\n  The solution involves using list comprehension to iterate over each number in the given list and include it in the new list only if it is positive (greater than zero).\n\n- Python3 code to solve the problem:\n  ```python\n  def get_positive(l: list):\n      return [num for num in l if num > 0]\n\n  # Test cases\n  print(get_positive([-1, 2, -4, 5, 6]))  # Output: [2, 5, 6]\n  print(get_positive([5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10]))  # Output: [5, 3, 2, 3, 9, 123, 1]\n  ```"], "prompt_tokens": [277], "completion_tokens": [748], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": false, "language": "Python3"}

The trial division algorithm is a straightforward method to test primality:\n\n1. If the number `n` is less than 2, it is not prime.\n2. Check if `n` is divisible by any integer from 2 to the square root of `n`. The square root is used as an optimization because if `n` has a factor larger than its square root, it must also have a factor smaller than its square root, so we don't need to check numbers beyond that.\n3. If any divisor is found, `n` is not prime.\n4.

There are several algorithms to find roots of polynomials, such as the Bisection method, Newton's method (also known as the Newton-Raphson method), and the Secant method. For polynomials with real coefficients, the Intermediate Value Theorem guarantees that if the polynomial changes sign over an interval, there is at least one root within that interval.\n\n## Tutorial:\n### Bisection Method:\nThe Bisection method is a simple iterative method that repeatedly bisects an interval and then selects a subinterval in which a root must lie for further processing. It is based on the Intermediate Value Theorem and requires the function to change signs over the interval.\n\n### Newton's Method:\nNewton's method uses the function and its derivative to rapidly converge to a root. It starts with an initial guess and iteratively improves the guess by applying the formula:\n\\[ x_{n+1} = x_n - \\frac{f(x_n)}{f'(x_n)} \\]\nThis method requires the calculation of the derivative of the function and does not guarantee global convergence.\n\n### Secant Method:\nThe Secant method is similar to Newton's method but does not require the calculation of the derivative. Instead, it approximates the derivative by using the slope of the line through two points on the function. The formula is:\n\\[ x_{n+1} = x_n - f(x_n) \\frac{x_n - x_{n-1}}{f(x_n) - f(x_{n-1})} \\]\nThis method can be seen as a finite-difference approximation of Newton's method.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Finding Square Roots**: The problem is to find the square root of a number N. Newton's method can be used here by considering the function \\( f(x) = x^2 - N \\) and applying the iterative formula to converge to the square root.\n\n2. **Solving Exponential Equations**: Given an equation of the form \\( e^x = c \\), where c is a constant, find the value of x. Newton's method can be applied to the function \\( f(x) = e^x - c \\).\n\n3. **Interest Rate Calculation**: In financial mathematics, one might need to solve for the interest rate in an annuity formula. This can be formulated as a root-finding problem where the polynomial represents the present value of an annuity as a function of the interest rate.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\nSince the problem specifies that the polynomial has an even number of coefficients and the largest non-zero coefficient is positive, it guarantees that the polynomial has at least one real root.

It also includes a helper function `poly_derivative` to calculate the derivative of the polynomial.

The deduplication process involves removing duplicate elements from a list, leaving only unique elements. Sorting is the process of arranging the elements of a list in a certain order, typically in ascending or descending numerical or lexicographical order.\n\n## Tutorial:\nDeduplication can be achieved in Python using various methods. One common approach is to use a set, which is an unordered collection of unique elements. By converting a list to a set, you automatically remove any duplicate elements. However, since sets are unordered, you will lose the original order of elements. If the order is important, you can use a dictionary or an ordered set (from the `collections` module) to maintain the order while removing duplicates.\n\nSorting in Python can be done using the built-in `sorted()` function, which returns a new sorted list from the elements of any iterable. The `sorted()` function has a key parameter to specify a function to be called on each list element prior to making comparisons.\n\nHere's a simple example of how to use these concepts:\n\n```python\nnumbers = [5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123]\nunique_numbers = set(numbers)  # Deduplication\nsorted_unique_numbers = sorted(unique_numbers)  # Sorting\nprint(sorted_unique_numbers)  # Output: [0, 2, 3, 5, 9, 123]\n```\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array**: Given a sorted array nums, remove the duplicates in-place such that each element appears only once and returns the new length. Do not allocate extra space for another array; you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.\n\n   Solution: Iterate through the array, compare each element with the next one, and if they are the same, remove the current element. Since the array is already sorted, this will effectively remove all duplicates.\n\n2. **Find All Numbers Disappeared in an Array**: Given an array of integers where 1 \u2264 a[i] \u2264 n (n = size of array), some elements appear twice and others appear once. Find all the elements of [1, n] inclusive that do not appear in this array.\n\n   Solution: Use a set to store all the numbers from 1 to n, then iterate through the array and remove the numbers that appear in the array. The remaining numbers in the set are the missing numbers.\n\n3. **Group Anagrams**: Given an array of strings, group anagrams together.\n\n   Solution: Use a dictionary to group words by their sorted tuple of characters.

This is a fundamental algorithm in computer science known as a linear search or scan.\n\n## Tutorial:\nA linear search algorithm iterates through all elements in a data structure, in this case, a list, to search for a target value. In the context of finding the maximum element, the target is not a specific value but rather the largest value in the list.\n\nHere's how the algorithm works for finding the maximum element:\n1. Initialize a variable to hold the maximum value. This can be the first element in the list or a value that is guaranteed to be lower than any element in the list (e.g., negative infinity).\n2. Iterate through each element in the list.\n3. For each element, compare it with the current maximum value.\n4. If the current element is greater than the current maximum, update the maximum value with the current element.\n5. Continue this process until the end of the list.\n6.

The encode function rotates each group of three characters to the left by one position. The decode function needs to reverse this process, rotating to the right by one position to restore the original string.\n\n## Tutorial:\nString manipulation is a common task in competitive programming, which involves altering, parsing, or encoding strings in various ways. In this problem, we are dealing with a specific kind of string manipulation called \"cycling\" or \"rotation.\"\n\nWhen we cycle a group of characters, we move each character to the position of the next character in the group, with the last character moving to the first position. For example, cycling the group 'abc' to the left gives 'bca'. To cycle to the right, 'abc' would become 'cab'.\n\nTo implement this in Python, we can use slicing. Slicing allows us to get a substring of a string using a start and end index. For example, `s[1:]` would give us all characters of the string `s` except the first one, and `s[0]` would give us the first character. We can concatenate these slices to perform the cycling.\n\nTo decode the string, we need to reverse the encoding process. This means we need to cycle each group of three characters to the right instead of to the left. This can be done by taking the last character of the group and concatenating it with the rest of the group excluding the last character.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Rotate Array**: Given an array, rotate the array to the right by k steps, where k is non-negative.\n   Solution: This can be solved by slicing the array into two parts and swapping them. For an array `arr` and a number of steps `k`, we can do `arr[-k:] + arr[:-k]`.\n\n2. **String Compression**: Given a string, compress it using the counts of repeated characters. For example, \"aabcccccaaa\" would become \"a2b1c5a3\".\n   Solution: Iterate through the string, keeping track of the current character and its count. When the character changes, append the character and its count to the result.\n\n3. **Caesar Cipher**: Given a string and a number, shift each character in the string by that number in the alphabet.\n   Solution: For each character, convert it to its ASCII value, add the shift amount, and then convert it back to a character. Be sure to wrap around if the end of the alphabet is reached.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\nFor the `decode_cyclic` function, we need to reverse the encoding process. This means for each group of three characters, we take the last character and move it to the front. If a group has fewer than three characters, we leave it as is.\n\nHere's the Python3 code to solve the problem:\n\n```python\ndef decode_cyclic(s: str):\n    \"\"\"\n    takes as input string encoded with encode_cyclic function.

This approach is efficient and avoids the need for a brute-force solution, which would involve checking all possible combinations of three numbers.\n\n## Tutorial:\nThe two-pointer technique is often used in array and list problems to find pairs or triplets of numbers that meet certain criteria. The basic idea is to sort the list first and then use two pointers to scan through the list from opposite ends or from a fixed point to the end, depending on the problem.\n\nFor the problem at hand, we can sort the list and then iterate through it. For each number, we can use two additional pointers to find if there is a pair whose sum is equal to the negative of the current number. This works because if `a + b + c = 0`, then `a + b = -c`.\n\nHere's how the algorithm works step by step:\n1. Sort the list of numbers.\n2. Iterate through the sorted list. Let the current number be `a`.\n3. For each `a`, set two pointers: one at the element immediately after `a` (let's call this `b`), and one at the end of the list (let's call this `c`).\n4. Check if `a + b + c == 0`. If it does, return `True`.\n5. If `a + b + c > 0`, move the `c` pointer one step to the left (decreasing the sum).\n6. If `a + b + c < 0`, move the `b` pointer one step to the right (increasing the sum).\n7. Repeat steps 4-6 until the `b` and `c` pointers meet.\n8. If no triplet is found that sums to zero, return `False` after the iteration is complete.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Two Sum**: Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.\n   - Solution: Use a hash map to store the difference between the target and each element as you iterate through the array. If you find a number in the map, you have found a pair that sums up to the target.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def two_sum(nums, target):\n         num_map = {}\n         for i, num in enumerate(nums):\n             complement = target - num\n             if complement in num_map:\n                 return [num_map[complement], i]\n             num_map[num] = i\n         return []\n     ```\n\n2. **3Sum Closest**: Given an array nums of n integers and an integer target, find three integers in nums such that the sum is closest to target. Return the sum of the three integers.\n   - Solution: Similar to the original problem, sort the array and use a fixed pointer and two moving pointers to find the closest sum.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def three_sum_closest(nums, target):\n         nums.sort()\n         closest_sum = float('inf')\n         for i in range(len(nums) - 2):\n             left, right = i + 1, len(nums) - 1\n             while left < right:\n                 current_sum = nums[i] + nums[left] + nums[right]\n                 if abs(target - current_sum) < abs(target - closest_sum):\n                     closest_sum = current_sum\n                 if current_sum < target:\n                     left += 1\n                 elif current_sum > target:\n                     right -= 1\n                 else:\n                     return target\n         return closest_sum\n     ```\n\n3. **4Sum**: Given an array nums of n integers and an integer target, are there elements a, b, c, and d in nums such that a + b + c + d = target?

If all objects move at the same speed and in opposite directions, every unique pair of objects moving towards each other will eventually meet.\n\nTo solve this problem, we can imagine \"freezing\" one set of cars and doubling the speed of the other set.

The simplest and most Pythonic way is to use a list comprehension.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Problem**: Given a list of integers, return a new list with each element squared.\n   **Solution**: Use a list comprehension to square each element.\n   ```python\n   def square_list(l):\n       return [x**2 for x in l]\n   ```\n\n2. **Problem**: Given a list of strings, return a new list with the length of each string.\n   **Solution**: Iterate over the list and use the `len` function on each element.\n   ```python\n   def length_of_strings(string_list):\n       return [len(s) for s in string_list]\n   ```\n\n3. **Problem**: Given a list of booleans, return the count of `True` values in the list.\n   **Solution**: Use the `sum` function which treats `True` as 1 and `False` as 0.\n   ```python\n   def count_true(bool_list):\n       return sum(bool_list)\n   ```\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n- Explanation of the solution:\nThe solution involves creating a new list where each element is the result of incrementing the corresponding element from the input list by 1. This can be done succinctly with a list comprehension.\n\n- Python3 code to solve the problem:\n```python\ndef incr_list(l):\n    return [x + 1 for x in l]\n\n# Test cases\nprint(incr_list([1, 2, 3]))  # Output: [2, 3, 4]\nprint(incr_list([5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123]))  # Output: [6, 4, 6, 3, 4, 4, 10, 1, 124]\n```\n\nThis code defines the function `incr_list` which takes a list `l` as an argument and returns a new list with each element incremented by 1. The list comprehension `[x + 1 for x in l]` creates this new list by iterating over each element `x` in the input list `l` and adding 1 to it."], "prompt_tokens": [272], "completion_tokens": [626], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": true, "language": "Python3"}

A number base (or radix) is the number of unique digits, including zero, used to represent numbers in a positional numeral system. For example, base-10 (decimal) uses the digits 0-9, base-2 (binary) uses 0 and 1, and base-16 (hexadecimal) uses 0-9 and A-F.\n\nTo convert a number from base-10 to another base, you can use the division-remainder method:\n1. Divide the number by the base you are converting to.\n2. Write down the remainder.\n3. Use the quotient from the division as the new number to divide by the base.\n4. Repeat steps 1-3 until the quotient is 0.\n5. The remainders, read in reverse order, give the number in the new base.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Binary to Decimal Conversion**: Given a binary number, convert it to its decimal equivalent. The solution involves multiplying each digit by 2 raised to the power of its position and summing these values.\n\n2. **Decimal to Hexadecimal Conversion**: Given a decimal number, convert it to its hexadecimal equivalent. Similar to the original problem, but the base is 16, and the digits include 0-9 and A-F.\n\n3. **Base Conversion**: Given a number in base `a`, convert it to base `b`. This problem can be solved in two steps: first, convert the number from base `a` to base-10, and then from base-10 to base `b` using the division-remainder method.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\nThe function `change_base` takes an integer `x` and a base `base` and converts `x` to the given base. The algorithm divides `x` by `base` and stores the remainder. This process is repeated until `x` becomes 0.

Dynamic programming is a method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems. It is applicable when the problem can be divided into overlapping subproblems that can be solved independently.\n\nIn the context of the `fib4` sequence, dynamic programming can be used to build up the solution iteratively from the base cases, storing the results of the subproblems in a table (or array) to avoid redundant calculations.\n\n## Tutorial:\nDynamic programming typically involves two steps:\n1. Defining the subproblem: In our case, the subproblem is to find the `fib4` value for a smaller index.\n2. Constructing the solution to the problem from the solutions to the subproblems: We use the results of the subproblems to calculate the result for the current problem.\n\nFor the `fib4` sequence, we can use an array to store the results of the subproblems. We start by initializing the array with the base cases. Then, for each subsequent index `i`, we calculate `fib4(i)` using the formula `fib4(i) = fib4(i-1) + fib4(i-2) + fib4(i-3) + fib4(i-4)` and store the result in the array. This way, when we need to calculate `fib4(i)` for a larger `i`, we can simply look up the values for `fib4(i-1)`, `fib4(i-2)`, `fib4(i-3)`, and `fib4(i-4)` in the array instead of recalculating them.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Fibonacci Sequence**: Given `n`, calculate the `n`-th Fibonacci number. The Fibonacci sequence is defined as `fib(0) = 0`, `fib(1) = 1`, and `fib(n) = fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)` for `n > 1`. The dynamic programming approach involves building an array where each element at index `i` stores `fib(i)`. The solution is similar to the `fib4` problem but with only two previous values being summed.\n\n2. **Climbing Stairs**: You are climbing a staircase. It takes `n` steps to reach the top. Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top? This problem can be solved using dynamic programming by recognizing that the number of ways to reach step `i` is the sum of the ways to reach step `i-1` and `i-2`.\n\n3. **Coin Change**: Given an unlimited supply of coins of given denominations and a total amount of money `amount`, compute the number of ways to make up that amount. This problem can be solved using dynamic programming by building a table where each entry `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to make up amount `i` using the given coin denominations.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\nWe will create an array `dp` of size `n+1` to store the `fib4` values for each index up to `n`.

The median is the middle value in a list of numbers; to find it, you must first sort the list in ascending or descending order. If the list has an odd number of elements, the median is the middle element. If the list has an even number of elements, the median is the average of the two middle elements.\n\n## Tutorial:\nSorting is a fundamental algorithm in computer science used to order the elements of a list in a sequence. There are several sorting algorithms, each with its own advantages and disadvantages in terms of time complexity, space complexity, and ease of implementation. Common sorting algorithms include:\n\n1. **Bubble Sort**: A simple comparison-based algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. It has a time complexity of O(n^2).\n\n2. **Insertion Sort**: Builds the final sorted array one item at a time. It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort. Time complexity is O(n^2).\n\n3. **Merge Sort**: An efficient, general-purpose, comparison-based sorting algorithm. It divides the unsorted list into n sublists, each containing one element, and then repeatedly merges sublists to produce new sorted sublists until there is only one sublist remaining. Time complexity is O(n log n).\n\n4. **Quicksort**: An efficient sorting algorithm that uses a divide-and-conquer approach. It works by selecting a 'pivot' element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. Time complexity is O(n log n) on average.\n\n5. **Heapsort**: A comparison-based sorting algorithm that uses a binary heap data structure. It builds a heap from the input data, then repeatedly extracts the maximum element from the heap and reconstructs the heap. Time complexity is O(n log n).\n\nFor the problem of finding the median, we can use any sorting algorithm, but for efficiency, we typically use algorithms with a time complexity of O(n log n), such as merge sort, quicksort, or the built-in Python sorting function, which is based on the Timsort algorithm.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Kth Smallest Element in a List**: Given a list of numbers and a number k, return the kth smallest element in the list. The solution involves sorting the list and then accessing the element at index k-1.\n\n2. **Find the Closest Pair from Two Sorted Arrays**: Given two sorted arrays and a target number, find a pair from each array whose sum is closest to the target number. The solution involves two pointers technique after sorting.\n\n3. **Three Number Sum**: Given an array of integers and a target sum, find all unique triplets in the array which gives the sum of the target. The solution involves sorting the array and then using a combination of two pointers technique and binary search.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\nTo find the median, we will sort the list using the built-in `sorted()` function.

This is a method used to efficiently compute `b^n mod m` for large values of `n` and `m`. The naive approach of computing `b^n` first and then taking the modulo `m` is not feasible due to the potential size of `b^n`. Modular exponentiation takes advantage of the properties of modulo operation to reduce the problem to manageable sizes.\n\n## Tutorial:\nModular exponentiation is based on the following principles:\n1. `(a * b) mod m = ((a mod m) * (b mod m)) mod m`\n2. `a^b mod m = (a mod m)^b mod m`\n3. `a^(b+c) mod m = (a^b mod m) * (a^c mod m) mod m`\n4. `a^(2b) mod m = (a^b mod m)^2 mod m`\n\nUsing these properties, we can break down the exponentiation into a series of smaller multiplications, which are then reduced modulo `m`. This is typically done using an algorithm called binary exponentiation or square-and-multiply. The idea is to represent the exponent `n` in binary and square the base `b` for each bit, multiplying it into the result when the corresponding bit in `n` is 1.\n\nHere's a step-by-step process:\n1. Convert `n` to binary.\n2. Initialize the result as 1.\n3. Loop through each bit of `n` from the least significant bit to the most significant bit:\n   - If the current bit is 1, multiply the result by `b` and take modulo `m`.\n   - Square `b` and take modulo `m`.\n4. Return the result.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Fast Exponentiation**: Given two integers `a` and `b`, compute `a^b`. The solution involves using the binary exponentiation algorithm to compute the result efficiently.\n\n2. **Modular Inverse**: Given an integer `a` and a modulus `m`, find the modular inverse of `a` modulo `m`, which is the number `b` such that `(a * b) mod m = 1`. This can be solved using the extended Euclidean algorithm or by computing `a^(m-2) mod m` if `m` is prime (from Fermat's little theorem).\n\n3. **RSA Encryption/Decryption**: In RSA, encryption and decryption involve modular exponentiation. For example, to encrypt a message `m`, you compute `c = m^e mod n`, and to decrypt it, you compute `m = c^d mod n`, where `e` and `d` are the public and private exponents, respectively, and `n` is the modulus.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\nWe will use the binary exponentiation algorithm to compute `2^n mod p`.

In this case, the shift is by 5 positions. The algorithm involves converting characters to their ASCII values, performing the shift, and then converting them back to characters.\n\n## Tutorial:\nThe Caesar cipher is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on.\n\nTo implement a Caesar cipher in Python, you can use the `ord()` function to convert a character to its corresponding ASCII value, then add or subtract the shift value to perform the encoding or decoding. After the shift, you need to wrap around the alphabet if necessary, which can be done using the modulo operator `%`. Finally, you can convert the ASCII value back to a character using the `chr()` function.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide to implementing the Caesar cipher:\n\n1. Convert the character to its ASCII value using `ord()`.\n2. Add or subtract the shift value to the ASCII value.\n3. Use the modulo operator to wrap around the alphabet if necessary.\n4. Convert the new ASCII value back to a character using `chr()`.\n5. Repeat the process for each character in the string.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Rot13 Cipher**: This is a special case of the Caesar cipher where the shift is 13. It is used in various online forums to hide spoilers, punchlines, puzzle solutions, and offensive materials.\n\n   Solution: Apply the same logic as the Caesar cipher with a fixed shift of 13.\n\n   ```python\n   def rot13(s):\n       return \"\".join([chr(((ord(ch) - ord('a') + 13) % 26) + ord('a')) if ch.islower() else ch for ch in s])\n   ```\n\n2. **Vigen\u00e8re Cipher**: A more complex form of the Caesar cipher that uses a keyword to determine the shift for each letter.\n\n   Solution: For each letter in the input, use a corresponding letter in the keyword to determine the shift, then apply the Caesar cipher logic.\n\n   ```python\n   def vigenere_encode(s, keyword):\n       keyword_repeat = (keyword * (len(s) // len(keyword) + 1))[:len(s)]\n       return \"\".join([chr(((ord(ch) - ord('a') + ord(k) - ord('a')) % 26) + ord('a')) for ch, k in zip(s, keyword_repeat)])\n   ```\n\n3. **Frequency Analysis**: This is a technique used to break the Caesar cipher by analyzing the frequency of letters in the encoded text.\n\n   Solution: Count the occurrences of each letter in the encoded text, compare it with the letter frequency in the language of the text, and deduce the shift used.\n\n   ```python\n   from collections import Counter\n\n   def frequency_analysis(s):\n       frequencies = Counter(s)\n       most_common = frequencies.most_common(1)[0][0]\n       shift = (ord(most_common) - ord('e')) % 26  # Assuming 'e' is the most common letter in English\n       return \"\".join([chr(((ord(ch) - ord('a') - shift) % 26) + ord('a')) for ch in s])\n   ```\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\nThe `decode_shift` function needs to reverse the encoding process. Since the encoding shifts every character by 5, decoding will shift in the opposite direction by 5.

After the iteration is complete, return the new string.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Problem: Reverse Vowels of a String**\n   - Description: Write a function that takes a string as input and reverse only the vowels of a string.\n   - Solution: Similar to removing vowels, we can use two pointers to iterate over the string from both ends, swapping vowels when both pointers point to vowels until they meet.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def reverseVowels(s):\n         vowels = \"aeiouAEIOU\"\n         s = list(s)\n         i, j = 0, len(s) - 1\n         while i < j:\n             if s[i] in vowels and s[j] in vowels:\n                 s[i], s[j] = s[j], s[i]\n                 i += 1\n                 j -= 1\n             if s[i] not in vowels:\n                 i += 1\n             if s[j] not in vowels:\n                 j -= 1\n         return ''.join(s)\n     ```\n\n2. **Problem: Replace All Digits with Characters**\n   - Description: You are given a 0-indexed string s that has lowercase English letters in its even indices and digits in its odd indices. Replace every digit with a letter following the digit's value times after the letter that precedes the digit.\n   - Solution: Iterate over the string, and when a digit is encountered, replace it with the character that is the digit's value times after the preceding character.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def replaceDigits(s):\n         s = list(s)\n         for i in range(1, len(s), 2):\n             s[i] = chr(ord(s[i-1]) + int(s[i]))\n         return ''.join(s)\n     ```\n\n3. **Problem: Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters**\n   - Description: Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.\n   - Solution: Use a sliding window approach to expand the window until a repeat character is found, then shrink the window from the left.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def lengthOfLongestSubstring(s):\n         charSet = set()\n         left = 0\n         result = 0\n         for right in range(len(s)):\n             while s[right] in charSet:\n                 charSet.remove(s[left])\n                 left += 1\n             charSet.add(s[right])\n             result = max(result, right - left + 1)\n         return result\n     ```\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n- Explanation of the solution:\n  The solution involves creating a set of vowels and then iterating over each character in the input string. If the character is not in the set of vowels, it is added to a new string. Finally, the new string is returned.\n\n- Python3 code to solve the problem:\n  ```python\n  def remove_vowels(text):\n      vowels = set(\"aeiouAEIOU\")\n      result = [char for char in text if char not in vowels]\n      return ''.join(result)\n\n  # Test cases\n  print(remove_vowels(''))  # Output: ''\n  print(remove_vowels(\"abcdef\\nghijklm\"))  # Output: 'bcdf\\nghjklm'\n  print(remove_vowels('abcdef'))  # Output: 'bcdf'\n  print(remove_vowels('aaaaa'))  # Output: ''\n  print(remove_vowels('aaBAA'))  # Output: 'B'\n  print(remove_vowels('zbcd'))  # Output: 'zbcd'\n  ```"], "prompt_tokens": [286], "completion_tokens": [979], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": false, "language": "Python3"}

This is a fundamental concept in programming, where you need to check each element of a list (or any iterable) against a condition. No specific advanced algorithms are required for this problem.\n\n## Tutorial:\nIterating over a list and comparing each element against a condition is a basic operation in Python. You can use a for loop to go through each element and an if statement to check the condition. If any element does not satisfy the condition, you can immediately return `False`. If the loop completes without finding any element that violates the condition, you can return `True`.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide to the process:\n\n1. Start a for loop to iterate over each element in the list.\n2. Inside the loop, use an if statement to check if the current element is greater than or equal to the threshold.\n3. If the condition is met, return `False` because we found an element that is not below the threshold.\n4. If the loop completes without returning `False`, it means all elements were below the threshold, so return `True`.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Check if a list is sorted**: Given a list of numbers, determine if the list is sorted in ascending order.\n   - Solution: Iterate through the list and compare each element to the next one. If you find an element that is greater than the next, the list is not sorted.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def is_sorted(lst):\n         for i in range(len(lst) - 1):\n             if lst[i] > lst[i + 1]:\n                 return False\n         return True\n     ```\n\n2. **Find the maximum element in a list**: Given a list of numbers, find the maximum value.\n   - Solution: Iterate through the list, keeping track of the maximum value found so far.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def find_max(lst):\n         max_val = lst[0]\n         for num in lst:\n             if num > max_val:\n                 max_val = num\n         return max_val\n     ```\n\n3. **Count elements within a range**: Given a list of numbers and a range specified by a lower and upper bound, count how many numbers fall within the range.\n   - Solution: Iterate through the list and increment a counter when an element falls within the specified range.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def count_within_range(lst, lower, upper):\n         count = 0\n         for num in lst:\n             if lower <= num <= upper:\n                 count += 1\n         return count\n     ```\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n- Explanation of the solution:\n  The solution involves iterating over each element in the list and checking if it is below the threshold.

The core concept here is the use of simple arithmetic without the need for any complex algorithms. In competitive programming, this would be considered a trivial problem, meant to test basic coding skills or to serve as an introductory example.\n\n## Tutorial:\nIn Python, arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division are performed using the `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/` operators, respectively. The addition operator `+` takes two operands and returns their sum. Python handles different data types such as integers, floats, and complex numbers, and the `+` operator can be used with these types.\n\nHere's a quick tutorial on how to use the `+` operator for different data types:\n\n- **Integers**: When you add two integers, the result is also an integer.\n  ```python\n  a = 10\n  b = 5\n  result = a + b  # result is 15\n  ```\n\n- **Floats**: Adding floats results in a float. If one operand is an integer and the other is a float, the result is a float.\n  ```python\n  a = 10.5\n  b = 2\n  result = a + b  # result is 12.5\n  ```\n\n- **Complex Numbers**: Python can also handle complex numbers, and you can add them using the `+` operator.\n  ```python\n  a = 1 + 2j\n  b = 3 + 4j\n  result = a + b  # result is (4+6j)\n  ```\n\n- **Strings**: The `+` operator can also be used to concatenate strings.\n  ```python\n  a = \"Hello\"\n  b = \"World\"\n  result = a + \" \" + b  # result is \"Hello World\"\n  ```\n\n## Example Problems:\nSince the addition operation is elementary, it's hard to find competitive programming problems that focus solely on addition without any additional complexity. However, here are three problems that involve addition as a part of their solution:\n\n1. **Sum of an Array**: Given an array of integers, find the sum of its elements.\n   - **Solution**: Iterate through the array and add each element to a running total.\n   - **Python3 Code**:\n     ```python\n     def array_sum(arr):\n         total = 0\n         for num in arr:\n             total += num\n         return total\n     ```\n\n2. **Prefix Sum**: Given an array of integers, return a new array where each element at index `i` is the sum of all elements up to index `i` in the original array.\n   - **Solution**: Iterate through the array, maintaining a running total and storing it in the new array.\n   - **Python3 Code**:\n     ```python\n     def prefix_sum(arr):\n         prefix = []\n         total = 0\n         for num in arr:\n             total += num\n             prefix.append(total)\n         return prefix\n     ```\n\n3. **Big Number Addition**: Given two very large numbers as strings, add them and return the result as a string.\n   - **Solution**: Perform the addition digit by digit from right to left, carrying over any excess to the next digit.\n   - **Python3 Code**:\n     ```python\n     def big_number_addition(a, b):\n         result = []\n         carry = 0\n         a, b = a[::-1], b[::-1]\n         for i in range(max(len(a), len(b))):\n             digit_a = int(a[i]) if i < len(a) else 0\n             digit_b = int(b[i]) if i < len(b) else 0\n             total = digit_a + digit_b + carry\n             carry = total // 10\n             result.append(str(total % 10))\n         if carry:\n             result.append(str(carry))\n         return ''.join(result[::-1])\n     ```\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nThe solution to the original problem is straightforward: we simply use the `+` operator to add the two numbers.\n\n- **Explanation of the solution**: The function `add` takes two integers `x` and `y` as arguments and returns their sum.\n\n- **Python3 code**:\n  ```python\n  def add(x: int, y: int) -> int:\n      return x + y\n\n  # Example usage:\n  if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n      print(add(2, 3))  # Output: 5\n      print(add(5, 7))  # Output: 12\n  ```\n\nThis function can be directly used to add two numbers, and the provided doctests can be run to verify the correctness of the function."], "prompt_tokens": [217], "completion_tokens": [995], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": false, "language": "Python3"}

The simplest way to solve this problem is by using set operations. Sets are a fundamental data structure in Python that store unordered collections of unique elements. By converting the strings into sets, we can easily compare them to see if they contain the same characters.\n\n## Tutorial:\nSets in Python are a powerful tool for solving problems that involve uniqueness and set operations like union, intersection, difference, and symmetric difference. Here's a brief tutorial on sets and their operations:\n\n1. **Creating a Set**: You can create a set by using curly braces `{}` or the `set()` function.\n   ```python\n   my_set = {1, 2, 3}\n   my_set = set([1, 2, 3])  # Creating a set from a list\n   ```\n\n2. **Adding Elements**: You can add elements to a set using the `add()` method.\n   ```python\n   my_set.add(4)\n   ```\n\n3. **Removing Elements**: You can remove elements from a set using the `remove()` or `discard()` methods.\n   ```python\n   my_set.remove(2)  # Raises KeyError if the element is not present\n   my_set.discard(3)  # Does not raise an error if the element is not present\n   ```\n\n4. **Set Operations**:\n   - **Union**: Combines the elements of two sets.\n     ```python\n     set1 = {1, 2, 3}\n     set2 = {3, 4, 5}\n     set1.union(set2)  # Output: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n     ```\n   - **Intersection**: Gets the common elements of two sets.\n     ```python\n     set1.intersection(set2)  # Output: {3}\n     ```\n   - **Difference**: Gets the elements that are in one set but not the other.\n     ```python\n     set1.difference(set2)  # Output: {1, 2}\n     ```\n   - **Symmetric Difference**: Gets the elements that are in either of the sets but not in both.\n     ```python\n     set1.symmetric_difference(set2)  # Output: {1, 2, 4, 5}\n     ```\n\n5. **Checking Subset and Superset**: You can check if a set is a subset or superset of another set.\n   ```python\n   set1.issubset(set2)  # Returns True if set1 is a subset of set2\n   set1.issuperset(set2)  # Returns True if set1 is a superset of set2\n   ```\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Anagram Check**: Given two strings, write a function to determine if they are anagrams of each other (contain the same characters with the same frequency).\n   Solution: Count the frequency of each character in both strings and compare the counts.\n\n2. **Unique Elements in Lists**: Given two lists, write a function to find the unique elements present in both lists.\n   Solution: Convert both lists to sets and use the intersection operation to find common unique elements.\n\n3. **Symmetric Difference**: Given two sets, write a function to find the elements that are in either of the sets but not in both.\n   Solution: Use the symmetric difference operation on the two sets to find the required elements.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\nTo solve the original problem, we will convert both input strings into sets and then compare these sets.

Using Binet's formula (a closed-form expression)\n\nFor competitive programming, the most efficient approach is often dynamic programming due to its lower time complexity compared to the naive recursive solution.\n\n## Tutorial:\n### Recursive Algorithm:\nThe recursive algorithm directly implements the definition of the Fibonacci sequence. It calls itself with the two previous numbers until it reaches the base cases (0 and 1).\n\n```python\ndef fib_recursive(n):\n    if n <= 1:\n        return n\n    else:\n        return fib_recursive(n-1) + fib_recursive(n-2)\n```\n\nHowever, this approach is highly inefficient for large `n` because it recalculates the same Fibonacci numbers multiple times, leading to an exponential time complexity.\n\n### Dynamic Programming:\nDynamic programming is a method for solving problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems and storing the results of these subproblems to avoid redundant calculations.\n\n#### Memoization:\nMemoization is a top-down approach where we use a cache to store the results of subproblems. When a Fibonacci number is calculated, it is stored. If the same number is needed again, it is retrieved from the cache instead of being recalculated.\n\n```python\ndef fib_memo(n, memo={}):\n    if n in memo:\n        return memo[n]\n    if n <= 1:\n        return n\n    memo[n] = fib_memo(n-1, memo) + fib_memo(n-2, memo)\n    return memo[n]\n```\n\n#### Tabulation:\nTabulation is a bottom-up approach where we solve all subproblems starting from the smallest and iteratively build up the solution to the larger problem. We use an array to store the results of subproblems.\n\n```python\ndef fib_tabulation(n):\n    if n <= 1:\n        return n\n    fib_table = [0] * (n+1)\n    fib_table[1] = 1\n    for i in range(2, n+1):\n        fib_table[i] = fib_table[i-1] + fib_table[i-2]\n    return fib_table[n]\n```\n\n### Binet's Formula:\nBinet's formula is a closed-form expression that allows us to calculate the nth Fibonacci number directly without recursion or iteration. However, due to floating-point precision issues, it is not commonly used in programming.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Climbing Stairs**: You are climbing a staircase. It takes `n` steps to reach the top. Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?\n   - Solution: This problem is a direct application of the Fibonacci sequence, where the number of ways to reach step `n` is the sum of the ways to reach step `n-1` and `n-2`.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def climbStairs(n):\n         a, b = 1, 1\n         for _ in range(n):\n             a, b = b, a + b\n         return a\n     ```\n\n2. **Maximum Subarray**: Given an integer array `nums`, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.\n   - Solution: This problem can be solved using dynamic programming, specifically Kadane's algorithm.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def maxSubArray(nums):\n         max_current = max_global = nums[0]\n         for num in nums[1:]:\n             max_current = max(num, max_current + num)\n             max_global = max(max_global, max_current)\n         return max_global\n     ```\n\n3. **Coin Change**: You are given coins of different denominations and a total amount of money `amount`. Write a function to compute the fewest number of coins that you need to make up that amount.\n   - Solution: This problem can be solved using dynamic programming by building a table that represents the minimum number of coins for each amount up to the target.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def coinChange(coins, amount):\n         dp = [float('inf')] * (amount + 1)\n         dp[0] = 0\n         for coin in coins:\n             for x in range(coin, amount + 1):\n                 dp[x] = min(dp[x], dp[x - coin] + 1)\n         return dp[amount] if dp[amount] != float('inf') else -1\n     ```\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n### Explanation of the solution:\nFor the original problem, we will use the iterative approach (tabulation) to calculate the nth Fibonacci number. This approach is efficient and avoids the stack overflow issue that can occur with the recursive approach for large `n`.\n\n### Python3 code to solve the problem:\n```python\ndef fib(n: int) -> int:\n    if n <= 1:\n        return n\n    prev, curr = 0, 1\n    for _ in range(2, n + 1):\n        prev, curr = curr, prev + curr\n    return curr\n\n# Test cases\nprint(fib(10))  # Output: 55\nprint(fib(1))   # Output: 1\nprint(fib(8))   # Output: 21\n```\n\nThis code defines a function `fib` that calculates the nth Fibonacci number using an iterative approach. It initializes two variables `prev` and `curr` to represent the two previous Fibonacci numbers and iterates until it reaches the desired `n`, updating these variables at each step. The final value of `curr` is the nth Fibonacci number."], "prompt_tokens": [216], "completion_tokens": [1248], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": true, "language": "Python3"}

The stack is ideal for this kind of problem because it allows us to process the brackets in a last-in, first-out (LIFO) manner, which is exactly what we need when trying to match pairs of brackets.\n\n## Tutorial:\nA stack is a collection of elements with two principal operations: push, which adds an element to the collection, and pop, which removes the most recently added element. When we process a string of brackets, we can push opening brackets onto the stack and pop them when we encounter a corresponding closing bracket.\n\nHere's how you can use a stack to check for correct bracketing:\n1. Initialize an empty stack.\n2. Iterate over the string of brackets.\n3. For each character:\n   - If it is an opening bracket, push it onto the stack.\n   - If it is a closing bracket, check if the stack is not empty and the top of the stack is the corresponding opening bracket. If so, pop the top of the stack. Otherwise, the string is not correctly bracketed.\n4. After processing all the brackets, if the stack is empty, then all opening brackets had a corresponding closing bracket, and the string is correctly bracketed. If the stack is not empty, then there are unmatched opening brackets, and the string is not correctly bracketed.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Balanced Parentheses**: Given a string containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid. The brackets must close in the correct order.\n   - Solution: Use a stack to keep track of opening brackets. When a closing bracket is encountered, check if it matches the top of the stack. If it does, pop the stack; otherwise, the string is not balanced.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def is_valid(s: str) -> bool:\n         stack = []\n         mapping = {')': '(', '}': '{', ']': '['}\n         for char in s:\n             if char in mapping:\n                 top_element = stack.pop() if stack else '#'\n                 if mapping[char] != top_element:\n                     return False\n             else:\n                 stack.append(char)\n         return not stack\n     ```\n\n2. **Longest Valid Parentheses**: Given a string containing just the characters '(' and ')', find the length of the longest valid (well-formed) parentheses substring.\n   - Solution: Use a stack to keep track of indices of '(' characters. When a ')' is encountered, pop the stack and calculate the length of the current valid substring.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def longest_valid_parentheses(s: str) -> int:\n         stack = [-1]\n         max_length = 0\n         for i, char in enumerate(s):\n             if char == '(':\n                 stack.append(i)\n             else:\n                 stack.pop()\n                 if stack:\n                     max_length = max(max_length, i - stack[-1])\n                 else:\n                     stack.append(i)\n         return max_length\n     ```\n\n3. **Remove Invalid Parentheses**: Remove the minimum number of invalid parentheses in order to make the input string valid. Return all possible results.\n   - Solution: Use a breadth-first search (BFS) to generate all possible states by removing one parenthesis at a time, and use the stack-based method to check if a state is valid.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def remove_invalid_parentheses(s: str):\n         def is_valid(s):\n             count = 0\n             for char in s:\n                 if char == '(':\n                     count += 1\n                 elif char == ')':\n                     count -= 1\n                 if count < 0:\n                     return False\n             return count == 0\n\n         level = {s}\n         while True:\n             valid = list(filter(is_valid, level))\n             if valid:\n                 return valid\n             next_level = set()\n             for seq in level:\n                 for i in range(len(seq)):\n                     if seq[i] in '()':\n                         next_level.add(seq[:i] + seq[i+1:])\n             level = next_level\n     ```\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n- Explanation of the solution:\n  We will use a stack to keep track of the '<' brackets. When we encounter a '>', we will check if there is a corresponding '<' on top of the stack. If the stack is empty or there is no matching '<', we return False.

Similarly, to determine if a list is monotonically decreasing, you would check that for every pair of adjacent elements `a` and `b`, `a >= b` holds true.\n\nHere's a step-by-step approach to check for monotonicity:\n\n1.

After the loop, if either `increasing` or `decreasing` is still `True`, the list is monotonic.\n\nThis algorithm has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements in the list, because it requires a single pass through the list.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Longest Monotonic Subsequence**: Given a sequence of numbers, find the length of the longest subsequence that is either monotonically increasing or decreasing.\n   - Solution: This problem can be solved using dynamic programming by maintaining two arrays that track the length of the longest increasing and decreasing subsequence ending at each index.\n   - Python3 code: (This would require a more complex code snippet than the original problem.)\n\n2. **Peak Index in a Mountain Array**: An array is called a mountain array if it is strictly increasing and then strictly decreasing. The problem is to find the peak index where the switch from increasing to decreasing happens.\n   - Solution: This can be solved using binary search to find the peak element in O(log n) time.\n   - Python3 code: (This would require implementing binary search.)\n\n3. **Valid Mountain Array**: Given an array, return true if and only if it is a valid mountain array.\n   - Solution: Similar to the peak index problem, but you must also check that there is at least one increasing and one decreasing element.\n   - Python3 code: (This would require checking both the increasing and decreasing parts of the array.)\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\nThe solution involves iterating through the list and checking if the sequence is either non-decreasing or non-increasing.

This process is repeated until the number is reduced to 1. The prime factors are the divisors used in this process.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide to the trial division method:\n\n1. Start with the smallest prime number, which is 2.\n2. Divide the number `n` by 2 as many times as possible until the result is no longer an integer.\n3. Move to the next smallest prime number (3, 5, 7, 11, ...) and repeat the process.\n4. Continue this process until the number is reduced to 1.\n5. The largest prime number used in this process is the largest prime factor.\n\nAn optimization to this method is to stop the process once the current divisor exceeds the square root of the current number `n`. This is because if `n` is not a prime number, it must have a factor less than or equal to its square root.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Sum of Prime Factors**: Given a number, find the sum of all its prime factors. The solution involves finding all prime factors and adding them up.\n\n2. **Count of Prime Factors**: Given a number, count the number of distinct prime factors it has. This can be done by modifying the prime factorization algorithm to count unique factors instead of finding the largest one.\n\n3. **Smallest Prime Factor**: Given a number, find the smallest prime factor. This is a simpler version of the problem where we only need to find the first prime factor.\n\nFor each of these problems, the solution would involve a variation of the prime factorization algorithm, tailored to either sum, count, or find the smallest prime factor.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\nThe function `largest_prime_factor` will use the trial division method to find the largest prime factor. We will start by dividing `n` by 2 until it is no longer even. Then we will proceed with odd numbers starting from 3. We will only need to check divisors up to the square root of `n` because if `n` has a factor larger than its square root, it will have a corresponding factor smaller than the square root.\n\nHere's the Python code:\n\n```python\ndef largest_prime_factor(n: int) -> int:\n    # Initialize the largest prime factor\n    largest_factor = None\n    \n    # Divide out the factor of 2 first\n    while n % 2 == 0:\n        largest_factor = 2\n        n //= 2\n    \n    # Check for odd factors starting from 3\n    factor = 3\n    while factor * factor <= n:\n        while n % factor == 0:\n            largest_factor = factor\n            n //= factor\n        factor += 2\n    \n    # If n is a prime number greater than 2\n    if n > 2:\n        largest_factor = n\n    \n    return largest_factor\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(largest_prime_factor(13195))  # Output: 29\nprint(largest_prime_factor(2048))   # Output: 2\n```\n\nThis code will correctly find the largest prime factor of the given number `n`."], "prompt_tokens": [227], "completion_tokens": [771], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": true, "language": "Python3"}

For example, the sequence 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 is an AP with a common difference of 2.\n\nThe sum of the first n terms of an arithmetic progression can be found using the formula:\n\nS_n = n/2 * (a_1 + a_n)\n\nwhere:\n- S_n is the sum of the first n terms,\n- n is the number of terms to be added,\n- a_1 is the first term, and\n- a_n is the nth term.\n\nFor the sequence of natural numbers starting from 1, the first term a_1 is 1, and the nth term a_n is n.

The stack is ideal for this kind of problem because it allows us to process the brackets in a last-in, first-out (LIFO) manner, which is exactly what we need when trying to match pairs of brackets.\n\n## Tutorial:\nA stack is a collection of elements with two principal operations: push, which adds an element to the collection, and pop, which removes the most recently added element. In the context of checking for correct bracketing, we can use a stack to keep track of the opening brackets. Here's how the algorithm works:\n\n1. Initialize an empty stack.\n2. Iterate over each character in the input string.\n3. If the current character is an opening bracket, push it onto the stack.\n4. If the current character is a closing bracket, check if the stack is empty. If it is, this means there is no corresponding opening bracket, and we can return False.\n5. If the stack is not empty, pop the top element from the stack. If the popped element is not an opening bracket that corresponds to the current closing bracket, return False.\n6. After processing all characters, if the stack is empty, all brackets were correctly matched, and we return True. If the stack is not empty, there are unmatched opening brackets, so we return False.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Balanced Parentheses**: Given a string containing three types of brackets: '()', '{}', and '[]', determine if the input string is valid. The brackets must close in the correct order.\n   - Solution: Use a stack to track opening brackets. When a closing bracket is encountered, check if it matches the top of the stack. If it does, pop the stack; otherwise, the string is not balanced.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def is_balanced(s):\n         bracket_map = {')': '(', '}': '{', ']': '['}\n         stack = []\n         for char in s:\n             if char in bracket_map.values():\n                 stack.append(char)\n             elif char in bracket_map.keys():\n                 if stack == [] or bracket_map[char] != stack.pop():\n                     return False\n         return stack == []\n     ```\n\n2. **Longest Valid Parentheses**: Given a string containing just the characters '(' and ')', find the length of the longest valid (well-formed) parentheses substring.\n   - Solution: Use a stack to keep track of indices of '(' characters. When a ')' is encountered, pop the stack and calculate the length of the current valid substring.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def longest_valid_parentheses(s):\n         stack = [-1]\n         max_length = 0\n         for i, char in enumerate(s):\n             if char == '(':\n                 stack.append(i)\n             else:\n                 stack.pop()\n                 if not stack:\n                     stack.append(i)\n                 else:\n                     max_length = max(max_length, i - stack[-1])\n         return max_length\n     ```\n\n3. **Generate Parentheses**: Given n pairs of parentheses, write a function to generate all combinations of well-formed parentheses.\n   - Solution: Use backtracking to generate all possible combinations and use a stack to validate the parentheses.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def generate_parenthesis(n):\n         def backtrack(s='', left=0, right=0):\n             if len(s) == 2 * n:\n                 result.append(s)\n                 return\n             if left < n:\n                 backtrack(s + '(', left + 1, right)\n             if right < left:\n                 backtrack(s + ')', left, right + 1)\n         result = []\n         backtrack()\n         return result\n     ```\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n- Explanation of the solution:\n  We will use a stack to keep track of the opening brackets.

It is applicable to problems exhibiting the properties of overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure. When a problem can be divided into overlapping subproblems, which are smaller versions of the original problem, and the optimal solution to the problem can be constructed from the optimal solutions of its subproblems, dynamic programming can be used.\n\nThe idea is to store the results of these subproblems in a table (usually an array or a dictionary) so that when the same subproblem occurs, instead of recomputing its solution, one simply looks up the previously computed solution, thereby saving computation time at the expense of a (usually) modest expenditure in storage space. This technique of storing solutions to subproblems is called memoization.\n\nA classic example of a problem that can be solved by dynamic programming is the Fibonacci sequence, where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. The FibFib sequence is a variation of this, where each number is the sum of the three preceding ones.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Fibonacci Sequence**: Given `n`, calculate the `n`-th Fibonacci number.

It takes `n` steps to reach the top. Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

This problem can be solved using dynamic programming by building up a table `ways` where `ways[i]` will be storing the number of ways to get the total amount `i`.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\nTo solve the FibFib sequence problem, we will use dynamic programming.

The algorithm involves iterating over each character in the string and checking if it is a vowel. The vowels are predefined ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u', and conditionally 'y'). The count of vowels is incremented each time a vowel is encountered. A special case is considered for the letter 'y' when it is at the end of the word.\n\n## Tutorial:\nString manipulation is a common task in programming where you need to process and analyze text data. Iterating over a string involves accessing each character one by one and performing some operation. In Python, strings are iterable, which means you can use a loop to go through each character.\n\nTo solve problems involving string manipulation, you often use loops (like `for` or `while`), conditional statements (`if`), and sometimes string methods (like `lower()` to convert the string to lowercase).\n\nWhen checking for vowels, you can use an `if` statement to see if the current character is in a set or list of vowels. Python's `in` keyword is useful for this purpose. For the special case of 'y', you can check if it is the last character in the string by comparing its index to the length of the string minus one.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Counting Letters in a String**: Given a string, count the number of occurrences of a specific letter.\n   - Solution: Iterate over the string and increment a counter each time the specified letter is encountered.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def count_letter(s, letter):\n         return s.count(letter)\n     ```\n\n2. **Palindrome Checker**: Check if a given string is a palindrome (reads the same backward as forward, ignoring case).\n   - Solution: Convert the string to lowercase and compare it to its reverse.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def is_palindrome(s):\n         return s.lower() == s[::-1].lower()\n     ```\n\n3. **Longest Vowel Chain**: Find the length of the longest substring that consists only of vowels.\n   - Solution: Iterate over the string, keeping track of the current chain of vowels and the maximum length found.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def longest_vowel_chain(s):\n         vowels = \"aeiou\"\n         max_length = 0\n         current_length = 0\n         for char in s:\n             if char in vowels:\n                 current_length += 1\n                 max_length = max(max_length, current_length)\n             else:\n                 current_length = 0\n         return max_length\n     ```\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n- Explanation of the solution:\n  The solution involves iterating over the string and checking if each character is a vowel.

A circular shift is a type of operation where the elements of an array or a number are shifted in a circular fashion. In the context of numbers, it means rearranging the digits of the number such that the digits are moved from one end to the other as if the number were a loop.\n\n## Tutorial:\nA circular shift can be performed in two directions: left or right. In a right circular shift, each digit is moved one place to the right, and the last digit becomes the first. In a left circular shift, each digit is moved one place to the left, and the first digit becomes the last.\n\nTo implement a circular shift in Python, you can convert the number to a string to easily manipulate the digits. Then, you can use slicing to rearrange the digits according to the shift value. If the shift value is greater than the number of digits, you can simply reverse the string.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide to implementing a right circular shift:\n1. Convert the number to a string.\n2. Determine the number of digits in the number.\n3. Calculate the effective shift by taking the shift value modulo the number of digits.\n4. Use string slicing to rearrange the digits: move the last 'shift' digits to the front and append the remaining digits at the end.\n5. If the shift value is greater than the number of digits, reverse the string instead.\n6. Return the result as a string.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Rotate Array**: Given an array, rotate the array to the right by k steps, where k is non-negative.\n   Solution: Similar to the circular shift of digits, you can use slicing to rotate the array. First, normalize the rotation steps by taking the modulo with the array length. Then, slice the array into two parts and swap them.\n   Python3 code:\n   ```python\n   def rotate_array(nums, k):\n       k = k % len(nums)\n       nums[:] = nums[-k:] + nums[:-k]\n       return nums\n   ```\n\n2. **String Rotation**: Given two strings, s1 and s2, write a function to check if s2 is a rotation of s1 using only one call to a function like `isSubstring`.\n   Solution: Concatenate s1 with itself and check if s2 is a substring of the result. This works because any rotation of s1 will appear as a substring in s1+s1.\n   Python3 code:\n   ```python\n   def is_rotation(s1, s2):\n       if len(s1) == len(s2) and len(s1) > 0:\n           return s2 in (s1 + s1)\n       return False\n   ```\n\n3. **Permutation in String**: Given two strings s1 and s2, write a function to return true if s2 contains the permutation of s1.\n   Solution: Use a sliding window technique to check if any substring of s2 has the same character counts as s1.\n   Python3 code:\n   ```python\n   from collections import Counter\n   def check_inclusion(s1, s2):\n       s1_count = Counter(s1)\n       window_count = Counter(s2[:len(s1)])\n       for i in range(len(s1), len(s2)):\n           if window_count == s1_count:\n               return True\n           window_count[s2[i - len(s1)]] -= 1\n           if window_count[s2[i - len(s1)]] == 0:\n               del window_count[s2[i - len(s1)]]\n           window_count[s2[i]] += 1\n       return window_count == s1_count\n   ```\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\n- Convert the integer to a string to manipulate the digits.\n- Calculate the effective shift by taking the shift value modulo the number of digits.\n- If the shift is equal to the number of digits, return the original number.\n- If the shift is greater than the number of digits, return the reversed string.\n- Otherwise, perform the circular shift using string slicing and return the result.\n\nPython3 code:\n```python\ndef circular_shift(x, shift):\n    x_str = str(x)\n    num_digits = len(x_str)\n    \n    # If shift is greater than the number of digits, return reversed string\n    if shift >= num_digits:\n        return x_str[::-1]\n    \n    # Calculate effective shift\n    effective_shift = shift % num_digits\n    \n    # Perform circular shift\n    shifted_str = x_str[-effective_shift:] + x_str[:-effective_shift]\n    return shifted_str\n\n# Test cases\nprint(circular_shift(12, 1))  # Output: \"21\"\nprint(circular_shift(12, 2))  # Output: \"12\"\n```\n\nThis code will correctly perform a circular shift on the digits of the given integer and return the result as a string."], "prompt_tokens": [246], "completion_tokens": [1027], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": false, "language": "Python3"}

The algorithm for the given problem can be described as follows:\n\n1. Initialize two variables, `smallest_even` and `smallest_index`, to represent the smallest even number found and its index. Set `smallest_even` to a large number (e.g., `float('inf')`) to ensure any even number found will be smaller, and set `smallest_index` to `None`.\n\n2. Loop through the array with both the element and its index.\n\n3. For each element, check if it is even (i.e., `element % 2 == 0`).\n\n4. If the element is even and smaller than the current `smallest_even`, or if it is equal to `smallest_even` but the index is smaller than `smallest_index`, update `smallest_even` and `smallest_index` with the current element and index.\n\n5. After the loop, check if `smallest_index` is not `None`, which means an even number was found. If so, return `[smallest_even, smallest_index]`.\n\n6. If no even number was found, return an empty list `[]`.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Finding the Second Smallest Element**: Given an array of integers, find the second smallest element. The solution involves iterating through the array, keeping track of the smallest and second smallest elements.\n\n2. **Finding the Largest Even Number**: Given an array of integers, find the largest even number. Similar to the original problem, iterate through the array and keep track of the largest even number found.\n\n3. **Finding the Kth Smallest Element**: Given an array of integers and an integer k, find the kth smallest element in the array.

Initialize two pointers or indices, one at the start of the list (`left`) and one at the end (`right`).\n2. Create an empty list to store the result.\n3. While `left` is less than or equal to `right`:\n   - Find the minimum value from the list between `left` and `right` and append it to the result list.\n   - Increment the `left` pointer to exclude the last added minimum value from the next search.\n   - If `left` is still less than or equal to `right`, find the maximum value between `left` and `right` and append it to the result list.\n   - Decrement the `right` pointer to exclude the last added maximum value from the next search.\n4.

However, if we sort the list first, we can improve the time complexity to O(n log n) for the sorting step, plus O(n) for constructing the result, resulting in an overall time complexity of O(n log n).\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Zigzag Sequence**: Given a list of integers, rearrange them in a zigzag fashion such that `a[0] < a[1] > a[2] < a[3] > ...`.

The solution involves iterating over the string and keeping track of the current balance of 0s and 1s, incrementing a counter whenever the balance is zero.\n\n2. **Valid Anagram**: Given two strings s and t, write a function to determine if t is an anagram of s. The solution involves counting the occurrences of each character in both strings and then comparing these counts.\n\n3. **Sum of Unique Elements**: You are given an integer array nums. The unique elements of an array are the elements that appear exactly once in the array. Return the sum of all the unique elements of nums. The solution involves using a dictionary or a counter to keep track of the occurrences of each element and then summing up the elements that have a count of one.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n```python\ndef hex_key(num):\n    # Define the set of prime hexadecimal digits\n    prime_hex_digits = {'2', '3', '5', '7', 'B', 'D'}\n    \n    # Initialize the counter\n    prime_count = 0\n    \n    # Iterate over each character in the input string\n    for digit in num:\n        # Check if the digit is a prime hexadecimal digit\n        if digit in prime_hex_digits:\n            prime_count += 1\n    \n    # Return the count of prime hexadecimal digits\n    return prime_count\n\n# Test cases\nprint(hex_key(\"AB\"))  # Output: 1\nprint(hex_key(\"1077E\"))  # Output: 2\nprint(hex_key(\"ABED1A33\"))  # Output: 4\nprint(hex_key(\"123456789ABCDEF0\"))  # Output: 6\nprint(hex_key(\"2020\"))  # Output: 2\n```\n\nThe provided code defines the function `hex_key` which takes a hexadecimal number as a string and returns the count of prime hexadecimal digits within it.

The algorithm typically used for this conversion is to repeatedly divide the number by 2 and record the remainder at each step, which represents the binary digit (bit) at the corresponding position. The process is repeated until the number becomes zero. The binary digits are then read in reverse order to get the binary representation of the original decimal number.\n\n## Tutorial:\nTo convert a decimal number to binary, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Divide the decimal number by 2.\n2. Record the remainder (0 or 1). This is the least significant bit (LSB) of the binary representation.\n3. Update the decimal number to be the quotient of the division.\n4. Repeat steps 1-3 until the decimal number is 0.\n5. The binary representation is the sequence of remainders read in reverse order (from the last remainder to the first).\n\nIn Python, this can be implemented using a loop or recursion. Additionally, Python provides a built-in function `bin()` that can convert a decimal number to binary. However, the `bin()` function returns a string that starts with '0b', which is not the format required for this problem.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Reverse Binary**: Given a decimal number, convert it to binary, reverse the binary string, and then convert it back to a decimal number.\n   \n   Solution: Follow the steps to convert the decimal to binary, then reverse the string using slicing `[::-1]`, and finally use `int(binary_string, 2)` to convert the reversed binary string back to a decimal number.\n\n2. **Add Binary**: Given two binary strings, return their sum as a binary string.\n   \n   Solution: Convert both binary strings to decimal using `int(binary_string, 2)`, add them, and then convert the sum back to binary using the steps mentioned above or the `bin()` function.\n\n3. **Binary to Decimal**: Given a binary string, convert it to its decimal equivalent.\n   \n   Solution: Iterate over the binary string, and for each character, multiply the current total by 2 and add the binary digit (0 or 1). This is essentially treating the binary string as a number in base 2 and converting it to base 10.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\nThe function `decimal_to_binary` will implement the algorithm described above to convert a decimal number to binary. After obtaining the binary representation, it will add 'db' at the beginning and the end of the string to match the required format.\n\n```python\ndef decimal_to_binary(decimal):\n    binary_digits = []\n    while decimal > 0:\n        remainder = decimal % 2\n        binary_digits.append(str(remainder))\n        decimal = decimal // 2\n    binary_digits.reverse()\n    binary_string = ''.join(binary_digits)\n    return f\"db{binary_string}db\"\n\n# Test cases\nprint(decimal_to_binary(15))   # Output: \"db1111db\"\nprint(decimal_to_binary(32))   # Output: \"db100000db\"\n```\n\nThis code snippet defines the function `decimal_to_binary` which takes a decimal number as input and returns its binary representation in the specified format. It uses a while loop to divide the number by 2 and collect the remainders. After the loop, it reverses the list of remainders and joins them into a string to form the binary representation.

The algorithm involves iterating over the string and checking each set of three consecutive characters to ensure they are all distinct.\n\n## Tutorial:\nString traversal is a fundamental concept in programming where you iterate over each character in a string. In Python, strings are iterable, which means you can use a loop to go through each character one by one.\n\nWhen checking for distinct characters, you compare the characters at different positions. If any of the characters are the same, the condition for distinct characters is not met.\n\nFor the given problem, you need to check every group of three consecutive characters. This can be done using a loop that goes from the start of the string to the length of the string minus 2 (to prevent index out of range errors). At each step, you compare the current character, the next character, and the character after that. If all three are different, you continue; otherwise, you can conclude the string is not happy.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters**: Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.\n   - Solution: Use a sliding window approach to maintain a window of characters without duplicates. Move the window's end forward and use a set to track the characters in the current window. If a duplicate is found, move the window's start forward until the duplicate is removed.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def lengthOfLongestSubstring(s):\n         charSet = set()\n         left = 0\n         result = 0\n         for right in range(len(s)):\n             while s[right] in charSet:\n                 charSet.remove(s[left])\n                 left += 1\n             charSet.add(s[right])\n             result = max(result, right - left + 1)\n         return result\n     ```\n\n2. **Permutations of a String**: Given a string, write a function to compute all permutations of the string.\n   - Solution: Use recursion and backtracking to generate all possible permutations by swapping characters.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def permute(s, l, r, results):\n         if l == r:\n             results.append(''.join(s))\n         else:\n             for i in range(l, r + 1):\n                 s[l], s[i] = s[i], s[l]\n                 permute(s, l + 1, r, results)\n                 s[l], s[i] = s[i], s[l]  # backtrack\n     def getAllPermutations(s):\n         results = []\n         permute(list(s), 0, len(s) - 1, results)\n         return results\n     ```\n\n3. **Check If All Characters Have Equal Number of Occurrences**: Given a string, check if all characters of the string have the same frequency of occurrence.\n   - Solution: Use a dictionary to count the occurrences of each character, then check if all values in the dictionary are the same.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def areOccurrencesEqual(s):\n         char_count = {}\n         for char in s:\n             char_count[char] = char_count.get(char, 0) + 1\n         return len(set(char_count.values())) == 1\n     ```\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n- Explanation of the solution:\n  The solution involves iterating over the string with a window of size 3 and checking if the characters within this window are distinct. If at any point we find three consecutive characters that are not distinct, we return `False`. If we successfully traverse the string without finding such a group, we return `True`.\n\n- Python3 code to solve the problem:\n  ```python\n  def is_happy(s):\n      if len(s) < 3:\n          return False\n      for i in range(len(s) - 2):\n          if s[i] == s[i + 1] or s[i] == s[i + 2] or s[i + 1] == s[i + 2]:\n              return False\n      return True\n\n  # Test cases\n  print(is_happy(\"a\"))      # False\n  print(is_happy(\"aa\"))     # False\n  print(is_happy(\"abcd\"))   # True\n  print(is_happy(\"aabb\"))   # False\n  print(is_happy(\"adb\"))    # True\n  print(is_happy(\"xyy\"))    # False\n  ```"], "prompt_tokens": [285], "completion_tokens": [928], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": false, "language": "Python3"}

It is closely related to many areas of mathematics and has many applications ranging from logic to statistical physics, from evolutionary biology to computer science, etc.\n\nTo solve combinatorial problems, we often use the following principles:\n\n1. **Addition Principle**: If there are `a` ways to do something and `b` ways to do another thing, and these two things cannot happen at the same time (they are mutually exclusive), then there are `a + b` ways to choose one of these actions.\n\n2. **Multiplication Principle**: If there are `a` ways to do something and `b` ways to do another thing after that, then there are `a * b` ways to perform both actions.\n\n3. **Permutations**: The number of ways to order a set of items.\n\n4. **Combinations**: The number of ways to choose a subset of items from a larger set, where the order does not matter.\n\nIn the context of our problem, we can use these principles to count the number of valid numbers.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Counting Passwords**: Given a password length `n`, count the number of possible passwords that can be formed using only letters, where each password must start with a vowel.

This problem can be solved using combinatorics by calculating the combinations of rights and downs, or by using dynamic programming.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\nTo solve the original problem, we need to count the number of n-digit numbers that start with 1 and the number of n-digit numbers that end with 1. However, we must be careful not to double-count the numbers that both start and end with 1.\n\n- Numbers that start with 1: There is only 1 choice for the first digit, and for each of the remaining `n-1` digits, there are 10 choices (0-9). So there are `1 * 10^(n-1)` numbers that start with 1.\n- Numbers that end with 1: There are 10 choices for the first digit (1-9, excluding 0 because we want a positive integer), and for each of the remaining `n-2` digits, there are 10 choices. There is only 1 choice for the last digit. So there are `9 * 10^(n-2)` numbers that end with 1.\n- Numbers that both start and end with 1: There is only 1 choice for the first and last digits, and for each of the remaining `n-2` digits, there are 10 choices.

The remainder gives you the last digit of the number, which you can add to a sum variable. After taking the remainder, you divide the number by 10 (ignoring the remainder) to remove the last digit. You repeat this process until the number is 0.\n\n### Binary Conversion:\nOnce you have the sum of the digits, you can convert it to binary. The simplest way to do this in Python is by using the built-in `bin()` function, which takes an integer and returns a string representing the binary equivalent. However, the `bin()` function returns a string that starts with '0b', which represents that the following number is in binary. You need to remove this prefix before returning the result.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Convert a Number to Hexadecimal**: Given an integer, convert it to a hexadecimal string. The solution involves dividing the number by 16 and using the remainder to get the hexadecimal digit, similar to the binary conversion process.\n\n2. **Add Binary**: Given two binary strings, return their sum as a binary string. You would simulate the binary addition process, handling the carry as you add corresponding bits from the two strings.\n\n3. **Number of 1 Bits**: Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and returns the number of '1' bits it has (also known as the Hamming weight). This involves checking each bit of the number and counting how many times the bit is '1'.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n```python\ndef solve(N):\n    # Calculate the sum of digits\n    sum_of_digits = 0\n    while N > 0:\n        sum_of_digits += N % 10\n        N //= 10\n    \n    # Convert the sum to binary and remove the '0b' prefix\n    binary_sum = bin(sum_of_digits)[2:]\n    \n    return binary_sum\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(solve(1000))  # Output: \"1\"\nprint(solve(150))   # Output: \"110\"\nprint(solve(147))   # Output: \"1100\"\n```\n\n- Explanation of the solution:\nThe function `solve` first initializes a variable `sum_of_digits` to 0. It then enters a while loop that continues until `N` is 0. Inside the loop, it adds the last digit of `N` to `sum_of_digits` by taking `N % 10` and then removes the last digit from `N` by doing integer division `N //= 10`. After the loop, the sum of digits is converted to binary using `bin(sum_of_digits)`, and the '0b' prefix is removed by slicing the string from the third character onwards.

In Python, iteration can be done using loops, such as `for` or `while` loops. In this problem, we will use a `for` loop to iterate over the list of integers.\n\nConditional statements allow us to execute certain pieces of code only when a particular condition is met.

In this problem, we will use an `if` statement to check two conditions: whether the index is odd and whether the element is even.\n\nTo check if an index is odd, we can use the modulo operator `%`. An index `i` is odd if `i % 2 != 0`. To check if an element is even, we can also use the modulo operator: an element `x` is even if `x % 2 == 0`.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Sum of Even Numbers After Queries**: You are given an array `A` of integers and an array of queries.

Reassemble the words into a single string, ensuring that the original order of words and spaces is preserved.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Anagram Detection**: Given two strings, write a function to determine if one is an anagram of the other. An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.\n   - Solution: Sort the characters of both strings and compare the sorted strings for equality.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def is_anagram(str1, str2):\n         return sorted(str1) == sorted(str2)\n     ```\n\n2. **Group Anagrams**: Given an array of strings, group anagrams together.\n   - Solution: Use a dictionary to map the sorted version of each word to a list of its anagrams.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def group_anagrams(strs):\n         anagrams = {}\n         for word in strs:\n             sorted_word = ''.join(sorted(word))\n             if sorted_word not in anagrams:\n                 anagrams[sorted_word] = [word]\n             else:\n                 anagrams[sorted_word].append(word)\n         return list(anagrams.values())\n     ```\n\n3. **Longest Word in Dictionary through Deleting**: Given a string and a dictionary of words, find the longest word in the dictionary that can be formed by deleting some characters of the given string. If there are more than one possible results, return the longest word with the smallest lexicographical order.\n   - Solution: Sort the dictionary by word length and lexicographical order. Check each word against the given string to see if it can be formed by deleting characters.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def find_longest_word(s, d):\n         d.sort(key=lambda x: (-len(x), x))\n         for word in d:\n             it = iter(s)\n             if all(char in it for char in word):\n                 return word\n         return ''\n     ```\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n- Explanation of the solution:\n  The solution involves iterating over each word in the input string, sorting the characters of each word, and then reassembling the string. We need to handle spaces correctly, ensuring that the structure of the original sentence is preserved.\n\n- Python3 code to solve the problem:\n  ```python\n  def anti_shuffle(s):\n      words = s.split(' ')\n      sorted_words = [''.join(sorted(word)) for word in words]\n      return ' '.join(sorted_words)\n\n  # Test cases\n  print(anti_shuffle('Hi'))  # Output: 'Hi'\n  print(anti_shuffle('hello'))  # Output: 'ehllo'\n  print(anti_shuffle('Hello World!!!'))  # Output: 'Hello !!!Wdlor'\n  ```\n\nNote that the provided solution assumes that punctuation attached to words should be considered part of the word for sorting purposes. If punctuation should be treated separately, additional logic would be required to handle that case."], "prompt_tokens": [294], "completion_tokens": [875], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": false, "language": "Python3"}

The algorithm involves two main steps:\n\n1. Iterating through each row and column of the nested list.\n2. Recording the positions (coordinates) where the target value is found.\n\nThe problem also requires sorting the list of coordinates. This involves understanding how to sort tuples in Python, particularly with custom sorting orders.\n\n## Tutorial:\nIterating through a nested list is a fundamental concept in Python. You can use a nested loop, where the outer loop goes through each row and the inner loop goes through each element (column) in that row.\n\nTo find the coordinates of a specific value, you can use the `enumerate` function, which gives you both the index and the value of elements in a list. This is useful for keeping track of the row and column indices.\n\nSorting in Python can be done using the `sorted` function or the `sort` method. When dealing with tuples, Python sorts them by the first element by default. If you need a custom sorting order, you can provide a `key` function to `sorted` or `sort` that returns a tuple with the elements in the order you want to sort by.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Matrix Search**: Given a matrix of integers and a target integer, return the coordinates of the target integer within the matrix. The solution involves iterating through the matrix and comparing each element with the target. If a match is found, the coordinates are recorded.\n\n2. **Transpose of a Matrix with Variable-Length Rows**: Given a nested list representing a matrix with variable-length rows, return the transpose of the matrix. The solution involves creating a new list of lists where each inner list represents a column of the original matrix.\n\n3. **Saddle Points in a Matrix**: A saddle point in a matrix is an element that is the smallest value in its row and the largest value in its column. The problem is to find all saddle points in a given matrix. The solution involves finding the minima of each row and the maxima of each column, then checking for elements that satisfy both conditions.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\nThe function `get_row` will iterate through each row and column of the given nested list `lst`. It will use `enumerate` to keep track of the current row and column indices. When it finds an occurrence of the integer `x`, it will append the coordinates to a list. After iterating through the entire list, it will sort the list of coordinates first by the row index in ascending order and then by the column index in descending order within each row.\n\n```python\ndef get_row(lst, x):\n    coordinates = []\n    # Iterate through each row and column to find the value x\n    for row_index, row in enumerate(lst):\n        for col_index, value in enumerate(row):\n            if value == x:\n                # Append the coordinates in (row, column) format\n                coordinates.append((row_index, col_index))\n    \n    # Sort the coordinates by row in ascending order and by column in descending order\n    coordinates.sort(key=lambda coord: (coord[0], -coord[1]))\n    return coordinates\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(get_row([\n  [1,2,3,4,5,6],\n  [1,2,3,4,1,6],\n  [1,2,3,4,5,1]\n], 1))  # Output: [(0, 0), (1, 4), (1, 0), (2, 5), (2, 0)]\n\nprint(get_row([], 1))  # Output: []\n\nprint(get_row([[], [1], [1, 2, 3]], 3))  # Output: [(2, 2)]\n```\n\nThis code will correctly solve the problem as described."], "prompt_tokens": [423], "completion_tokens": [819], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": true, "language": "Python3"}

The most common sorting algorithms include Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and Heap Sort. Each has its own advantages and is suited for particular types of problems.\n\nFor this problem, we can use Python's built-in sorting function `sorted()`, which is an efficient, general-purpose sort algorithm (Timsort) that works well for various data sizes.\n\nTo sort an array in ascending order, you can simply call `sorted(array)`. To sort it in descending order, you can call `sorted(array, reverse=True)`.\n\nThe condition to decide the sorting order is based on the sum of the first and last elements. To check if a number is even or odd, you can use the modulo operator `%`. If `number % 2 == 0`, the number is even; otherwise, it's odd.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Sorting a list of tuples based on the second value**: Given a list of tuples, sort the list based on the second value of each tuple.

For example, with a shift of 1, 'A' would be replaced by 'B', 'B' would become 'C', and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.\n\nTo implement a Caesar Cipher in Python:\n1. Define the shift amount.\n2. Create a translation table that maps each letter to its shifted counterpart.\n3. Use the translation table to replace each letter in the original string with the letter from the table.\n\nWhen implementing a Caesar Cipher, it's important to handle the end of the alphabet. For example, if you're shifting 'Z' by one, it should wrap around to 'A'. This can be handled using modular arithmetic.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Rot13 Cipher**: This is a special case of the Caesar Cipher where the shift is 13 places. It is used in online forums as a means of hiding spoilers, punchlines, puzzle solutions, and offensive materials.\n\n   Solution: Apply a shift of 13 to each letter.

The provided solution assumes that uppercase letters should be shifted in the same way as lowercase letters and that non-alphabetic characters should remain unchanged.

Using a min-heap to extract the smallest elements until reaching the k-th smallest.\n3. Using the Quickselect algorithm, which is a selection algorithm to find the k-th smallest element in an unordered list.\n\nFor this problem, we will focus on the simplest approach, which is sorting the array.\n\n## Tutorial:\nSorting is a fundamental algorithm in computer science used to order the elements of a list in a certain sequence (most commonly in ascending or descending order). The most common sorting algorithms include Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and Heap Sort.\n\nFor this problem, we can use Python's built-in sorting function, which is based on the Timsort algorithm (a hybrid sorting algorithm derived from Merge Sort and Insertion Sort). After sorting the list, we can easily access the k-th smallest element by its index.\n\nHere's a brief explanation of how to use sorting to find the second smallest element:\n1. Sort the list in ascending order.\n2. Check if the list has at least two distinct elements.\n3. If it does, return the element at index 1 (the second element in the sorted list).\n4. If not, return None, as there is no second smallest element.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **K-th Largest Element in an Array**: Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return the k-th largest element in the array.\n   Solution: Sort the array in descending order and return the element at index k-1.\n   \n2. **Find the Median of Two Sorted Arrays**: Given two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively, return the median of the two sorted arrays.\n   Solution: Merge the two arrays into one sorted array and then find the median based on the combined array's length.\n   \n3. **Minimum Difference Between Largest and Smallest Value in Three Moves**: Given an array nums, you are allowed to make at most three moves on the array where each move involves selecting any index of the array and either increasing or decreasing the element by 1. Find the minimum difference between the largest and smallest value of nums after performing at most three moves.\n   Solution: Sort the array and consider the possible scenarios where the moves can be applied to minimize the difference.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\n- First, we will sort the list.\n- Then, we will iterate through the sorted list to find the second distinct smallest element.\n- If we find such an element, we return it; otherwise, we return None.\n\n```python\ndef next_smallest(lst):\n    if not lst or len(lst) < 2:\n        return None\n    \n    sorted_lst = sorted(lst)\n    first_smallest = sorted_lst[0]\n    \n    for element in sorted_lst[1:]:\n        if element != first_smallest:\n            return element\n    \n    return None\n\n# Test cases\nprint(next_smallest([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]))  # Output: 2\nprint(next_smallest([5, 1, 4, 3, 2]))  # Output: 2\nprint(next_smallest([]))               # Output: None\nprint(next_smallest([1, 1]))           # Output: None\n```\n\nThis code will correctly solve the problem by returning the second smallest distinct element in the list or None if there is no such element."], "prompt_tokens": [288], "completion_tokens": [762], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": true, "language": "Python3"}

In Python, strings are immutable sequences of Unicode characters, and there are several built-in methods and functions to work with them.\n\nTo solve problems like the one given, you would typically follow these steps:\n1. **Splitting Strings**: Use the `split()` method to divide a string into a list of substrings based on a delimiter. If no delimiter is specified, it defaults to splitting on whitespace.\n2. **Trimming Strings**: Use the `strip()` method to remove leading and trailing whitespace from a string. There are also `lstrip()` and `rstrip()` methods for removing whitespace from the left or right side, respectively.\n3. **String Comparison**: Use the `==` operator to compare strings for equality. Remember that string comparison is case-sensitive in Python.\n4. **Iterating over Strings**: Use a `for` loop to iterate over each element in a list of strings (e.g., sentences).\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Counting Words**: Given a string, count the number of words in it.

Then, we will iterate over each sentence, strip leading and trailing whitespace, and check if it starts with the word \"I\". If it does, we increment our boredom count. Finally, we return the count.\n\n- Python3 code:\n  ```python\n  import re\n\n  def is_bored(S):\n      # Split the string into sentences using the specified delimiters\n      sentences = re.split(r'[.?!]', S)\n      boredom_count = 0\n      \n      # Iterate over each sentence\n      for sentence in sentences:\n          # Strip leading and trailing whitespace and check if it starts with \"I\"\n          if sentence.strip().startswith(\"I\"):\n              boredom_count += 1\n              \n      return boredom_count\n\n  # Example usage:\n  print(is_bored(\"Hello world\"))  # Output: 0\n  print(is_bored(\"The sky is blue.

Replacing vowels with a specific letter based on their position in the alphabet.\n\n## Tutorial:\nString manipulation is a common task in programming, where you are required to modify or analyze text data. Python provides a rich set of methods to handle strings, which makes it a popular choice for text processing tasks.\n\n1. **Swapping Case**: In Python, you can swap the case of a letter using the `swapcase()` method. This method converts uppercase letters to lowercase and vice versa.\n\n2. **Replacing Characters**: To replace characters in a string, you can use the `replace()` method or a more general approach using a loop or a comprehension to iterate over the string and replace characters as needed.\n\n3. **Working with the Alphabet**: To find the letter that appears two places ahead of a given vowel in the English alphabet, you can create a mapping of vowels to their corresponding replacements. Alternatively, you can calculate the position of the letter in the alphabet and then find the letter at the new position after adding two.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Caesar Cipher**: A classic problem where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet. To solve this, you would iterate over each character in the input string, find its position in the alphabet, and then shift it by the specified number, wrapping around if necessary.\n\n2. **Palindrome Checker**: A problem where you need to determine if a string is a palindrome (reads the same backward as forward). You would typically normalize the string by converting it to the same case and removing non-alphanumeric characters, then check if the string is equal to its reverse.\n\n3. **String Compression**: Given a string, you need to compress it using the counts of repeated characters. For example, \"aabcccccaaa\" would become \"a2b1c5a3\". You would iterate over the string, keep track of the current character and its count, and build a new string with this information.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\n- Iterate over each character in the message.\n- Swap the case of the character using `swapcase()`.\n- If the character is a vowel, find the corresponding replacement by adding two to its position in the alphabet.\n- Construct the encoded message with the modified characters.\n\n```python\ndef encode(message):\n    vowels = 'aeiouAEIOU'\n    replacements = {'a': 'c', 'e': 'g', 'i': 'k', 'o': 'q', 'u': 'w',\n                    'A': 'C', 'E': 'G', 'I': 'K', 'O': 'Q', 'U': 'W'}\n    \n    encoded_message = ''\n    for char in message:\n        if char in vowels:\n            # Replace vowel with the letter two places ahead in the alphabet\n            encoded_char = replacements[char]\n        else:\n            # Keep the consonant as it is\n            encoded_char = char\n        # Swap the case of the character\n        encoded_message += encoded_char.swapcase()\n    \n    return encoded_message\n\n# Test cases\nprint(encode('test'))  # Output: 'TGST'\nprint(encode('This is a message'))  # Output: 'tHKS KS C MGSSCGG'\n```\n\nThis code will correctly encode the message as per the problem statement."], "prompt_tokens": [273], "completion_tokens": [717], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": true, "language": "Python3"}

Checking if a string is in upper case using `str.isupper()`.\n\n## Tutorial:\nWhen solving problems that involve checking the case of strings, Python provides built-in methods `islower()` and `isupper()` that can be called on string objects. These methods return `True` if the string is entirely in lower case or upper case, respectively, and `False` otherwise.\n\nTo iterate over the keys in a dictionary, you can use a for loop directly on the dictionary, which will give you the keys, or you can use the `.keys()` method to be more explicit.\n\nHere's a quick example of how these methods work:\n\n```python\nmy_string = \"hello\"\nprint(my_string.islower())  # Output: True\nprint(my_string.isupper())  # Output: False\n\nmy_dict = {\"A\": 1, \"B\": 2}\nfor key in my_dict:\n    print(key, key.isupper())  # Output: A True, B True\n```\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **String Validators**: Given a string, check if it contains any lowercase letters, uppercase letters, digits, etc. The solution involves iterating over the string and using `str.islower()`, `str.isupper()`, `str.isdigit()`, etc., to check for the presence of different types of characters.\n\n2. **Grouping Data**: Given a list of strings, group them into two lists: one containing all strings in lower case and the other containing all strings in upper case. This problem requires iterating over the list and checking the case of each string before appending it to the appropriate list.\n\n3. **Password Checker**: Write a function that checks if a password is strong. A strong password might be defined as one that contains both uppercase and lowercase characters, along with digits and special characters.

In Python, strings are immutable sequences of Unicode characters. Iteration over a string can be done using a for loop or other iteration constructs.\n\nTo solve problems involving string manipulation, you often need to access individual characters in a string.

For example, `s[0]` would give you the first character of the string `s`.\n\nWhen checking for uppercase vowels, you can create a set or list of vowels and then use the `in` keyword to check if a character is in that set. Python's `str` class also provides methods like `isupper()` to check if a character is uppercase.\n\nTo iterate over a string and check the index of each character, you can use the built-in `enumerate()` function, which returns both the index and the character.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Counting Specific Characters**: Given a string, count the number of times a specific character appears.\n   - Solution: Iterate over the string and use a counter to increment each time the specific character is encountered.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def count_character(s, char):\n         return s.count(char)\n     ```\n\n2. **Finding the First Non-Repeating Character**: Given a string, find the first non-repeating character and return its index.

There are several rounding methods, including:\n\n1. Round half up (common rounding): If the fractional part of the number is 0.5 or higher, round up; otherwise, round down.\n2. Round half down: If the fractional part of the number is greater than 0.5, round up; if it is less than 0.5, round down; if it is exactly 0.5, round towards zero.\n3. Round half to even (bankers' rounding): If the fractional part is exactly 0.5, round to the nearest even integer; otherwise, use common rounding.\n4. Round half away from zero: If the fractional part is exactly 0.5, round away from zero; otherwise, use common rounding.\n\nIn Python, the built-in `round()` function uses the round half to even method. However, for this problem, we need to implement the round half away from zero method. To do this, we can use the `math.floor()` and `math.ceil()` functions from the `math` module to round down or up respectively, and then apply the correct logic to handle the case when the number is exactly halfway between two integers.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Rounding Grades**: Students receive grades on a scale from 0 to 100. Any grade less than 40 is a failing grade. Sam wants to round the grades according to these rules: if the difference between the grade and the next multiple of 5 is less than 3, round the grade up to the next multiple of 5; if the grade is less than 38, don't round it. Write a function to apply the rounding rules to a list of grades.\n\n2. **Bankers' Rounding**: Implement a function that takes a floating-point number and rounds it to the nearest integer using the bankers' rounding method.\n\n3. **Price Rounding in a Cash Register**: A cash register rounds the total price to the nearest 0.05. Write a function that takes the total price and returns the rounded price according to this rule.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\nTo solve the problem, we will convert the string to a float, then check if the decimal part is exactly 0.5. If it is, we will round away from zero. Otherwise, we will use the built-in `round()` function.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef closest_integer(value):\n    number = float(value)\n    decimal_part = number - math.floor(number)\n    \n    if decimal_part == 0.5 or decimal_part == -0.5:\n        if number > 0:\n            return math.ceil(number)\n        else:\n            return math.floor(number)\n    else:\n        return round(number)\n\n# Examples\nprint(closest_integer(\"10\"))    # Output: 10\nprint(closest_integer(\"15.3\"))  # Output: 15\nprint(closest_integer(\"14.5\"))  # Output: 15\nprint(closest_integer(\"-14.5\")) # Output: -15\n```\n\nThis code correctly implements the \"round half away from zero\" method and will return the closest integer according to the problem's specifications."], "prompt_tokens": [320], "completion_tokens": [740], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": true, "language": "Python3"}

An arithmetic progression is a sequence of numbers such that the difference between the consecutive terms is constant. In this case, the difference is not constant but follows a pattern based on the parity of the level.\n\n## Tutorial:\nAn arithmetic progression (AP) is defined by its first term (a1), the number of terms (n), and the common difference (d) between the terms. The nth term of an AP can be calculated using the formula:\n\nan = a1 + (n - 1) * d\n\nHowever, in this problem, the common difference is not constant but depends on whether the current term is odd or even. If the current term is odd, the next term is the next odd number, and if it's even, the next term is the next even number. This means the difference alternates between 2 and 1 in a predictable pattern.\n\nTo solve this problem, we can start with the first level having n stones and then iteratively add the next odd or even number to the previous level's number of stones until we reach the nth level.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Fibonacci Sequence**: Given a number n, print the first n Fibonacci numbers. The Fibonacci sequence is a series where the next term is the sum of the previous two terms. The first two terms of the Fibonacci sequence are 0 and 1.\n\n2. **Sum of an Arithmetic Progression**: Given the first term (a1), the common difference (d), and the number of terms (n), find the sum of the n terms of the arithmetic progression.\n\n3. **Collatz Sequence**: Given a starting number n, follow the Collatz sequence rules: if n is even, divide it by 2; if n is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1. Continue this process until n becomes 1. Return the sequence as a list.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\nWe will start with the first level having n stones. Then, for each subsequent level, we will check if the current number of stones is odd or even. If it's odd, we will add 2 to get the next odd number.

In Python, this can be easily achieved using the `split()` method.\n\n## Tutorial:\nString splitting is a common operation in text processing where a string is divided into a list of substrings based on a specified delimiter. In Python, the `split()` method is used for this purpose. It takes a delimiter as an argument and returns a list of substrings. If no delimiter is specified, it defaults to splitting on whitespace.\n\nHere's a quick example:\n```python\ntext = \"apple,banana,cherry\"\nwords = text.split(\",\")  # Splitting on comma\nprint(words)  # Output: ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']\n```\n\nWhen dealing with multiple delimiters, such as commas and spaces, you can use a regular expression with the `re.split()` method from the `re` module. This allows you to define a pattern for the delimiters.\n\nExample with `re.split()`:\n```python\nimport re\ntext = \"apple, banana cherry\"\nwords = re.split(r'[,\\s]+', text)  # Splitting on comma or space\nprint(words)  # Output: ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']\n```\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Tokenizing a string**: Given a string and a set of delimiters, tokenize the string into words. The solution involves using `re.split()` to handle multiple delimiters.\n\n2. **CSV Parser**: Write a function to parse a CSV (Comma-Separated Values) file and return a list of lists, where each sublist represents a row of CSV data. The solution involves reading each line of the file and using `split(',')` to separate the values.\n\n3. **Log File Parsing**: Given a log file where each line contains a timestamp followed by a message, separated by a space, write a function to return a list of messages without timestamps. The solution involves using `split()` and slicing to extract the message part of each line.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n- Explanation of the solution:\nThe solution involves using the `split()` method to split the input string on spaces and commas. However, since the input can contain both spaces and commas, we will use the `re.split()` method from the `re` module to define a regular expression pattern that matches both delimiters.\n\n- Python3 code to solve the problem:\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef words_string(s):\n    # Split the string on comma or space using regular expression\n    words = re.split(r'[,\\s]+', s.strip())\n    return words\n\n# Test cases\nprint(words_string(\"Hi, my name is John\"))  # Output: [\"Hi\", \"my\", \"name\", \"is\", \"John\"]\nprint(words_string(\"One, two, three, four, five, six\"))  # Output: [\"One\", \"two\", \"three\", \"four\", \"five\", \"six\"]\n```\n\nIn the code above, `r'[,\\s]+'` is a regular expression pattern where `[,\\s]` matches any comma `,` or whitespace character `\\s`, and the `+` means \"one or more\" of the preceding element. The `strip()` method is used to remove any leading or trailing whitespace from the input string before splitting."], "prompt_tokens": [280], "completion_tokens": [700], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": false, "language": "Python3"}

The `round()` function is used to round the average, although in this case, it is not strictly necessary since the average of an arithmetic sequence of integers will always be an integer.

Python lists have a built-in `reverse()` method that reverses the list in place, or you can use the slicing syntax `[::-1]` to create a reversed copy.\n\n### Mapping Values:\nMapping is the process of transforming each element in a list according to a certain mapping rule.

If a number is a palindrome, we then check if it is even or odd and increment the respective counter.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Largest Palindrome Product**: Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two n-digit numbers.\n   - Solution: Iterate through all possible products of two n-digit numbers, check if the product is a palindrome, and keep track of the largest palindrome found.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def largest_palindrome_product(n):\n         max_num = 10**n - 1\n         min_num = 10**(n-1)\n         max_palindrome = 0\n         for i in range(max_num, min_num - 1, -1):\n             for j in range(i, min_num - 1, -1):\n                 product = i * j\n                 if str(product) == str(product)[::-1] and product > max_palindrome:\n                     max_palindrome = product\n         return max_palindrome\n     ```\n\n2. **Palindrome Number**: Determine whether an integer is a palindrome without converting the integer to a string.\n   - Solution: Reverse the number mathematically and compare it with the original number.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def is_palindrome(x):\n         if x < 0:\n             return False\n         original, reversed_num = x, 0\n         while x > 0:\n             reversed_num = reversed_num * 10 + x % 10\n             x //= 10\n         return original == reversed_num\n     ```\n\n3. **Next Palindrome**: Given a number, find the smallest palindrome larger than this number.\n   - Solution: Increment the number until you find a palindrome.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def next_palindrome(n):\n         while True:\n             n += 1\n             if str(n) == str(n)[::-1]:\n                 return n\n     ```\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n- Explanation of the solution:\n  We will iterate through all numbers from 1 to n and check if each number is a palindrome. If it is, we will check if it is even or odd and increment the respective counter. Finally, we will return a tuple with the counts of even and odd palindromes.\n\n- Python3 code to solve the problem:\n  ```python\n  def even_odd_palindrome(n):\n      even_count = 0\n      odd_count = 0\n      for i in range(1, n + 1):\n          if str(i) == str(i)[::-1]:  # Check if the number is a palindrome\n              if i % 2 == 0:\n                  even_count += 1\n              else:\n                  odd_count += 1\n      return (even_count, odd_count)\n\n  # Example usage:\n  print(even_odd_palindrome(3))  # Output: (1, 2)\n  print(even_odd_palindrome(12)) # Output: (4, 6)\n  ```\nThis code will correctly count the number of even and odd palindromes within the given range."], "prompt_tokens": [375], "completion_tokens": [853], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": false, "language": "Python3"}

If it is, remember this fact and work with the absolute value of the number.\n3. Extract each digit of the number. This can be done by repeatedly using modulo and division operations.\n4. Sum the digits, taking into account the sign of the original number.\n5. Check if the sum of the digits meets the condition (in this case, greater than zero).\n6. Count the numbers that meet the condition.\n\nFor step 3, you can extract digits by using the modulo operator (`%`) to get the last digit and then divide the number by 10 (using integer division `//`) to remove the last digit. Repeat this process until all digits are processed.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Counting Numbers with a Certain Digit Sum**: Given an array of integers, count how many numbers have a digit sum equal to a specific value.

When we perform a right shift operation, we move the last element to the first position. If the array can be sorted by a series of right shifts, it means that the array is already sorted except for a single \"dip\" where the order is broken.\n\nTo solve this problem, we can iterate through the array and check if the elements are in non-decreasing order.

It is a greedy approach where we try to replace all odd numbers in `lst1` with even numbers from `lst2`.\n\n## Tutorial:\nTo solve this problem, we need to understand the following concepts:\n\n1. **Parity of Numbers**: A number is even if it is divisible by 2, and odd if it is not. In Python, we can check if a number is even by using the modulo operator (`%`) to see if the remainder when divided by 2 is zero.\n\n2. **Swapping Elements**: We can swap elements between two lists by simply reassigning their values. For example, `lst1[i], lst2[j] = lst2[j], lst1[i]` would swap the `i`-th element of `lst1` with the `j`-th element of `lst2`.\n\n3. **Greedy Approach**: A greedy algorithm builds up a solution piece by piece, always choosing the next piece that offers the most immediate benefit. In this case, we always choose to swap an odd number in `lst1` with an even number in `lst2`.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Two Arrays and Swaps**: Given two arrays `A` and `B` of the same length and an integer `K`, you can swap elements between `A` and `B` at most `K` times. The goal is to maximize the sum of elements in `A` after `K` swaps. The solution involves sorting both arrays and greedily swapping the smallest elements in `A` with the largest elements in `B`.\n\n2. **Largest Number After Digit Swaps by Parity**: Given a non-negative integer `N`, swap any two digits of `N` that have the same parity (both even or both odd) to get the largest possible value of `N`. The solution involves identifying the digits by parity and rearranging them in a descending order while maintaining the original order for digits of different parities.\n\n3. **Minimum Swaps to Group All 1's Together**: Given a binary array, you need to minimize the number of swaps required to bring all the 1's together in any place in the array.

In Python, the `dict` type is a hash map. It is very efficient for looking up, inserting, and deleting key-value pairs. When solving problems that require counting the frequency of elements, a hash map is often the go-to data structure because of its average-case constant time complexity for these operations.\n\nTo use a hash map for counting, you iterate over the elements you want to count (in this case, letters in a string) and use the element as the key in the hash map. If the key is not already in the hash map, you add it with a value of 1. If the key is already present, you increment the value associated with that key.\n\nAfter counting all occurrences, you can then iterate over the hash map to find the maximum frequency and extract the keys that have this maximum frequency.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Counting Words**: Given a list of words, return a dictionary with words as keys and their counts as values.\n   Solution: Iterate over the list, use each word as a key in a dictionary, and increment its value for each occurrence.\n   ```python\n   def count_words(words):\n       word_count = {}\n       for word in words:\n           word_count[word] = word_count.get(word, 0) + 1\n       return word_count\n   ```\n\n2. **Finding the Most Common Element**: Given a list of items, return the item that appears the most frequently.\n   Solution: Use a hash map to count the occurrences of each item, then iterate over the hash map to find the item with the highest count.\n   ```python\n   def most_common_element(items):\n       count_map = {}\n       max_count = 0\n       most_common = None\n       for item in items:\n           count_map[item] = count_map.get(item, 0) + 1\n           if count_map[item] > max_count:\n               max_count = count_map[item]\n               most_common = item\n       return most_common\n   ```\n\n3. **Finding All Elements with a Given Frequency**: Given a list and a frequency number, return all elements that appear exactly that many times.\n   Solution: Count the occurrences of each element using a hash map, then iterate over the hash map to collect all keys with the given frequency.\n   ```python\n   def elements_with_frequency(lst, frequency):\n       count_map = {}\n       for item in lst:\n           count_map[item] = count_map.get(item, 0) + 1\n       return [item for item, count in count_map.items() if count == frequency]\n   ```\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\n- Split the input string by spaces to get individual letters.\n- Use a dictionary to count the occurrences of each letter.\n- Find the maximum count.\n- Create a dictionary that includes only the letters with the maximum count.\n\n```python\ndef histogram(test):\n    # Split the string into letters and initialize an empty dictionary for counts\n    letters = test.split()\n    letter_count = {}\n\n    # Count the occurrences of each letter\n    for letter in letters:\n        letter_count[letter] = letter_count.get(letter, 0) + 1\n\n    # Find the maximum count\n    max_count = max(letter_count.values(), default=0)\n\n    # Return a dictionary with letters that have the maximum count\n    return {letter: count for letter, count in letter_count.items() if count == max_count}\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(histogram('a b c'))  # {'a': 1, 'b': 1, 'c': 1}\nprint(histogram('a b b a'))  # {'a': 2, 'b': 2}\nprint(histogram('a b c a b'))  # {'a': 2, 'b': 2}\nprint(histogram('b b b b a'))  # {'b': 4}\nprint(histogram(''))  # {}\n```\n\nThis code will correctly solve the problem by returning a dictionary of the letters with the most repetitions along with their corresponding counts.

The string manipulation part involves iterating through the characters of the input string `s` and removing any characters that match those in the string `c`. The palindrome checking part involves verifying whether the resulting string reads the same forwards and backwards.\n\n## Tutorial:\n### String Manipulation:\nString manipulation is a common task in programming that involves altering, parsing, or analyzing strings. In Python, strings are immutable, which means they cannot be changed after they are created. However, you can create new strings based on operations performed on the original string.\n\nTo remove characters from a string that match any character in another string, you can iterate through the original string and build a new string by appending only the characters that are not present in the second string.\n\n### Palindrome Checking:\nA palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequences of characters that reads the same forward and backward (ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization). To check if a string is a palindrome, you compare the characters from the beginning and the end of the string moving towards the center. If all the corresponding characters are the same, the string is a palindrome.\n\nIn Python, you can easily check for a palindrome by comparing the string to its reverse. You can reverse a string using slicing `reversed_string = original_string[::-1]` and then check if `original_string == reversed_string`.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Remove Vowels from a String**: Given a string, remove all vowels from it and return the new string.\n   - Solution: Iterate through the string and append only consonants to a new string.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def remove_vowels(s):\n         vowels = \"aeiouAEIOU\"\n         return ''.join([char for char in s if char not in vowels])\n     ```\n\n2. **Valid Palindrome with Removal**: Given a string, determine if it is a palindrome, considering only alphanumeric characters and ignoring cases. You are allowed to delete at most one character.\n   - Solution: Use two pointers to compare characters from both ends, skipping non-alphanumeric characters. If characters do not match, try skipping one character from either end.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def valid_palindrome(s):\n         def is_palindrome_range(i, j):\n             return all(s[k] == s[j-k+i] for k in range(i, j))\n         \n         s = ''.join(c.lower() for c in s if c.isalnum())\n         left, right = 0, len(s) - 1\n         \n         while left < right:\n             if s[left] != s[right]:\n                 return is_palindrome_range(left+1, right) or is_palindrome_range(left, right-1)\n             left, right = left + 1, right - 1\n         return True\n     ```\n\n3. **Longest Palindromic Substring**: Given a string `s`, find the longest palindromic substring in `s`.\n   - Solution: Expand around the center for each character and find the longest palindrome. Keep track of the maximum length palindrome found.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def longest_palindrome(s):\n         def expand_around_center(left, right):\n             while left >= 0 and right < len(s) and s[left] == s[right]:\n                 left -= 1\n                 right += 1\n             return s[left+1:right]\n         \n         longest = \"\"\n         for i in range(len(s)):\n             # Odd length palindrome\n             odd_palindrome = expand_around_center(i, i)\n             if len(odd_palindrome) > len(longest):\n                 longest = odd_palindrome\n             # Even length palindrome\n             even_palindrome = expand_around_center(i, i+1)\n             if len(even_palindrome) > len(longest):\n                 longest = even_palindrome\n         return longest\n     ```\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n- Explanation of the solution:\n  The solution involves two steps. First, we iterate through the string `s` and build a new string by excluding the characters that are present in `c`. Second, we check if the resulting string is a palindrome by comparing it to its reverse.\n\n- Python3 code to solve the problem:\n  ```python\n  def reverse_delete(s, c):\n      # Step 1: Remove characters from 's' that are in 'c'\n      result_string = ''.join([char for char in s if char not in c])\n      \n      # Step 2: Check if the result string is a palindrome\n      is_palindrome = result_string == result_string[::-1]\n      \n      return (result_string, is_palindrome)\n\n  # Example usage:\n  print(reverse_delete(\"abcde\", \"ae\"))       # Output: ('bcd', False)\n  print(reverse_delete(\"abcdef\", \"b\"))       # Output: ('acdef', False)\n  print(reverse_delete(\"abcdedcba\", \"ab\"))   # Output: ('cdedc', True)\n  ```"], "prompt_tokens": [326], "completion_tokens": [1056], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": false, "language": "Python3"}

However, since we are looking for the minimum sum (not the maximum, which is the usual application of Kadane's algorithm), we need to modify it slightly.\n\nKadane's algorithm is a dynamic programming approach that scans the entire array and at each position finds the maximum subarray sum ending at that position. To find the minimum subarray sum, we can invert the problem by changing the signs of all elements and then apply Kadane's algorithm to find the maximum subarray sum of this inverted array. The result will be the negative of the minimum subarray sum of the original array.\n\n## Tutorial:\nKadane's algorithm works by maintaining a running sum of the elements and resetting it to zero whenever it becomes negative. This is because any subarray contributing a negative sum can be omitted to potentially increase the overall sum.\n\nFor the minimum sum subarray, we invert the signs of the elements and apply the same logic. If the running sum becomes positive, we reset it to zero. The minimum sum is kept track of during the iteration, and at the end, we have the minimum sum subarray.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide to the modified Kadane's algorithm for minimum sum:\n\n1. Initialize two variables, `current_sum` and `min_sum`, to the first element of the array.\n2. Iterate through the array starting from the second element.\n3. Update `current_sum` by adding the current element.\n4. If `current_sum` is greater than 0, reset it to 0 since any positive sum will not contribute to the minimum sum.\n5. Update `min_sum` if `current_sum` is less than `min_sum`.\n6. Continue to the next element and repeat steps 3-5.\n7. After the loop, `min_sum` will contain the minimum subarray sum.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Maximum Subarray**: Given an integer array `nums`, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum. This is the classic application of Kadane's algorithm.\n\n2. **Maximum Circular Subarray Sum**: Given a circular integer array `nums` (where the last element is connected to the first), find the maximum contiguous subarray sum. This problem can be solved by finding the maximum subarray sum using Kadane's algorithm twice - once on the original array and once on the inverted array (to find the minimum subarray sum), and then combining the results.\n\n3. **Subarray Product Less Than K**: Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `k`, find the number of contiguous subarrays where the product of all the elements in the subarray is less than `k`. This problem involves a sliding window approach rather than Kadane's algorithm but is related to subarray problems.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n```python\ndef minSubArraySum(nums):\n    current_sum = min_sum = nums[0]\n    for num in nums[1:]:\n        current_sum = min(num, current_sum + num)\n        min_sum = min(min_sum, current_sum)\n    return min_sum\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(minSubArraySum([2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 4]))  # Output: 1\nprint(minSubArraySum([-1, -2, -3]))        # Output: -6\n```\n\n- Explanation of the solution:\nThe function `minSubArraySum` initializes `current_sum` and `min_sum` to the first element of the array. It then iterates through the array, updating `current_sum` by adding the current element or just taking the current element if that would result in a smaller sum. `min_sum` is updated whenever a new minimum is found.

In Python, strings are immutable sequences of Unicode characters. Python provides a rich set of methods to work with strings, such as `split()`, `replace()`, `upper()`, `lower()`, and many more.\n\nTo solve the given problem, we will use the `split()` method to divide the input string into a list of words. Then, we iterate over each word and count the consonants. In English, consonants are all letters except for the vowels (a, e, i, o, u). We can check if a character is a consonant by verifying that it is a letter and not a vowel.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide to the algorithm:\n1. Use `split()` to divide the string into words.\n2. Initialize an empty list to store the result.\n3. Iterate over each word in the list of words.\n4. For each word, iterate over each character and check if it is a consonant.\n5.

After processing all words, return the result list.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Count Vowels**: Given a string, count the number of vowels in it.\n   Solution: Iterate over each character in the string and check if it is a vowel. Increment a counter for each vowel found.\n   ```python\n   def count_vowels(s):\n       vowels = 'aeiouAEIOU'\n       return sum(1 for char in s if char in vowels)\n   ```\n\n2. **Palindrome Checker**: Given a string, determine if it is a palindrome, considering only alphanumeric characters and ignoring cases.\n   Solution: Filter out non-alphanumeric characters, convert the string to the same case, and then check if the string reads the same forwards and backwards.\n   ```python\n   def is_palindrome(s):\n       alphanumeric = [char.lower() for char in s if char.isalnum()]\n       return alphanumeric == alphanumeric[::-1]\n   ```\n\n3. **Longest Word in a Sentence**: Given a sentence, find the longest word.\n   Solution: Split the sentence into words, then iterate over the words to find the one with the maximum length.\n   ```python\n   def longest_word(sentence):\n       words = sentence.split()\n       return max(words, key=len)\n   ```\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\n- We will use the `split()` method to break the string into words.\n- We will define a helper function `count_consonants()` to count the consonants in a word.\n- We will iterate over each word and use the helper function to count consonants.\n- If the count matches `n`, we will add the word to our result list.\n- Finally, we will return the result list.\n\nHere is the Python3 code:\n\n```python\ndef select_words(s, n):\n    def count_consonants(word):\n        vowels = 'aeiouAEIOU'\n        return sum(1 for char in word if char.isalpha() and char not in vowels)\n    \n    words = s.split()\n    result = [word for word in words if count_consonants(word) == n]\n    return result\n\n# Examples:\nprint(select_words(\"Mary had a little lamb\", 4))  # ==> [\"little\"]\nprint(select_words(\"Mary had a little lamb\", 3))  # ==> [\"Mary\", \"lamb\"]\nprint(select_words(\"simple white space\", 2))      # ==> []\nprint(select_words(\"Hello world\", 4))             # ==> [\"world\"]\nprint(select_words(\"Uncle sam\", 3))               # ==> [\"Uncle\"]\n```\n\nThis code will correctly solve the problem as per the given examples."], "prompt_tokens": [345], "completion_tokens": [881], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": false, "language": "Python3"}

The task involves iterating over the characters of a string from right to left, checking for vowels and consonants, and identifying the first vowel that is surrounded by consonants.\n\n## Tutorial:\nString manipulation is a common task in programming, and it involves accessing, modifying, and analyzing the contents of strings. In Python, strings are immutable, meaning that once a string is created, its characters cannot be changed. However, you can create new strings based on operations performed on the original string.\n\nWhen iterating over a string, you can use a loop to examine each character. Python provides the `for` loop, which is commonly used to iterate over the elements of a sequence, such as a string.\n\nTo solve the given problem, you need to check each character to determine if it is a vowel or a consonant. In English, the vowels are 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u' (both uppercase and lowercase). All other alphabetic characters are considered consonants.\n\nThe algorithm to solve the problem is as follows:\n1. Define a set of vowels for easy checking.\n2. Iterate over the string from right to left.\n3. Keep track of the previous character to determine if it's a consonant.\n4. When a vowel is found, check if it's surrounded by consonants.\n5. If the condition is met, return the vowel.\n6. If the loop finishes without finding such a vowel, return an empty string.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters**: Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters. The solution involves using a sliding window technique to keep track of the characters in the current substring and updating the window as you iterate through the string.\n\n2. **Valid Palindrome**: Given a string, determine if it is a palindrome, considering only alphanumeric characters and ignoring cases. The solution involves two-pointer technique, where you compare characters from the beginning and the end, moving towards the center.\n\n3. **First Unique Character in a String**: Given a string, find the first non-repeating character in it and return its index. The solution involves using a hash map to count the occurrences of each character and then iterating over the string to find the first unique character.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\nThe solution involves iterating over the string from the end to the beginning. We use a flag to keep track of whether the previous character was a consonant. When we encounter a vowel, we check if both the previous and the next characters are consonants.

The idea is to traverse the string and use a stack to keep track of the open parentheses. When a close parenthesis is encountered, it should match the most recent open parenthesis (which is at the top of the stack). If at any point the stack is empty when we encounter a close parenthesis, or there are open parentheses left in the stack after processing the entire string, the string is not balanced.\n\n## Tutorial:\nTo check if parentheses in a string are balanced, we can use a stack data structure. Here's a step-by-step guide:\n\n1. Initialize an empty stack.\n2. Traverse the string from left to right.\n3. For each character:\n   - If it is an open parenthesis '(', push it onto the stack.\n   - If it is a close parenthesis ')':\n     - Check if the stack is empty. If it is, the string is not balanced (there's a closing parenthesis without a matching opening one).\n     - If the stack is not empty, pop the top element from the stack. This represents the matching opening parenthesis for the current closing parenthesis.\n4. After processing the entire string, check if the stack is empty. If it is, the string is balanced. If there are elements left in the stack, the string is not balanced (there are unmatched opening parentheses).\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Valid Parentheses**: Given a string containing just the characters '(', ')', determine if the input string is valid. The brackets must close in the correct order.\n   - Solution: Use the stack-based approach described above.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def isValid(s: str) -> bool:\n         stack = []\n         for char in s:\n             if char == '(':\n                 stack.append(char)\n             elif char == ')':\n                 if not stack or stack[-1] != '(':\n                     return False\n                 stack.pop()\n         return not stack\n     ```\n\n2. **Longest Valid Parentheses**: Given a string containing just the characters '(' and ')', find the length of the longest valid (well-formed) parentheses substring.\n   - Solution: Use a stack to keep track of indices of '(' characters. When a ')' is encountered, calculate the length of the valid substring.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def longestValidParentheses(s: str) -> int:\n         stack = [-1]\n         max_length = 0\n         for i, char in enumerate(s):\n             if char == '(':\n                 stack.append(i)\n             else:\n                 stack.pop()\n                 if stack:\n                     max_length = max(max_length, i - stack[-1])\n                 else:\n                     stack.append(i)\n         return max_length\n     ```\n\n3. **Generate Parentheses**: Given n pairs of parentheses, write a function to generate all combinations of well-formed parentheses.\n   - Solution: Use backtracking to generate all possible combinations and use the stack-based approach to validate them.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def generateParenthesis(n: int):\n         def backtrack(S='', left=0, right=0):\n             if len(S) == 2 * n:\n                 ans.append(S)\n                 return\n             if left < n:\n                 backtrack(S+'(', left+1, right)\n             if right < left:\n                 backtrack(S+')', left, right+1)\n\n         ans = []\n         backtrack()\n         return ans\n     ```\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n- Explanation of the solution:\n  To solve the original problem, we need to check if concatenating the two strings in any order results in a balanced string. We can do this by checking both possible concatenations. However, we can optimize this by realizing that if one string has more closing parentheses than opening ones, it must come second, otherwise, it will create an imbalance. Similarly, if one string has more opening parentheses than closing ones, it must come first.\n\n- Python3 code:\n  ```python\n  def match_parens(lst):\n      first, second = lst\n      # Count the number of open and close parentheses in both strings\n      open_first, close_first = first.count('('), first.count(')')\n      open_second, close_second = second.count('('), second.count(')')\n\n      # If one string has more closing parentheses, it must come second\n      if close_first > open_first:\n          first, second = second, first\n          open_first, close_first, open_second, close_second = open_second, close_second, open_first, close_first\n\n      # Check if after concatenating the two strings, they are balanced\n      return 'Yes' if open_first >= close_first and open_first + open_second == close_first + close_second else 'No'\n\n  # Examples\n  print(match_parens(['()(', ')']))  # Output: 'Yes'\n  print(match_parens([')', ')']))    # Output: 'No'\n  ```\nThis code checks the balance of parentheses in both strings and determines the correct order for concatenation to achieve a balanced string, if possible."], "prompt_tokens": [332], "completion_tokens": [1056], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": false, "language": "Python3"}

The task is to find the `k` largest elements in an array, which can be done efficiently by sorting the array in non-increasing order and then selecting the first `k` elements. Alternatively, if `k` is much smaller than the length of the array, a better approach might be to use a min-heap of size `k` to keep track of the `k` largest elements encountered so far.\n\n## Tutorial:\n### Sorting:\nSorting is a fundamental algorithm in computer science used to order the elements of a list in a sequence. Common sorting algorithms include Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Heap Sort, and Insertion Sort. The efficiency of these algorithms varies, with Quick Sort and Merge Sort generally performing well with average-case time complexities of O(n log n).\n\n### Selection:\nSelection algorithms are used to find the k-th smallest or largest element in a list without sorting the entire list. The Quickselect algorithm, for example, is a selection algorithm with an average-case complexity of O(n), which is based on the partitioning process of Quick Sort.\n\n### Min-Heap:\nA min-heap is a binary tree where the value of each node is greater than or equal to the value of its parent, with the minimum-value element at the root. A min-heap can be used to efficiently retrieve and update the `k` largest elements in a stream or collection. The Python `heapq` module provides functions for implementing heaps based on regular lists.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Kth Largest Element in an Array**:\n   Find the kth largest element in an unsorted array. This is similar to the given problem but requires finding only one element.\n   Solution: Use a sorting algorithm and return the element at index `len(arr) - k`. Alternatively, use a min-heap or Quickselect for better performance on large arrays.\n\n2. **Top K Frequent Elements**:\n   Given a non-empty array of integers, return the k most frequent elements.\n   Solution: Use a hash map to count the frequencies, then use a min-heap to keep track of the top k elements.\n\n3. **Find Median from Data Stream**:\n   The median is the middle value in an ordered integer list. If the size of the list is even, there is no middle value and the median is the mean of the two middle values.\n   Solution: Use two heaps (a max-heap for the first half of the numbers and a min-heap for the second half) to balance and quickly retrieve the median.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\nThe solution involves sorting the array in non-increasing order and then slicing the first `k` elements. This is the most straightforward approach and is efficient for the problem constraints.\n\n```python\ndef maximum(arr, k):\n    # Sort the array in non-increasing order\n    sorted_arr = sorted(arr, reverse=True)\n    # Return the first k elements\n    return sorted_arr[:k]\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(maximum([-3, -4, 5], 3))  # Output: [5, -3, -4]\nprint(maximum([4, -4, 4], 2))   # Output: [4, 4]\nprint(maximum([-3, 2, 1, 2, -1, -2, 1], 1))  # Output: [2]\n```\n\nNote that the `sorted` function returns a new sorted list, and the `reverse=True` parameter sorts the list in descending order. The slice `[:k]` takes the first `k` elements from the sorted list."], "prompt_tokens": [381], "completion_tokens": [762], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": false, "language": "Python3"}

In Python, you can iterate over a list using a `for` loop or a list comprehension.\n\nConditional statements allow you to execute certain pieces of code based on a condition. In Python, you can use `if` statements to check conditions.\n\nWhen combining iteration and conditional statements, you can perform checks on each element of a collection and execute code based on the outcome of those checks.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Filtering Even Numbers**: Given a list of integers, return a new list containing only the even numbers.\n   - Solution: Iterate through the list and use a conditional statement to check if each number is even.

We will check if the index is even (since list indices start at 0, even indices represent odd positions in a 1-based index system) and if the corresponding element is odd. If both conditions are met, we will add the element to a running sum. Finally, we will return the sum.\n\n- Python3 code:\n  ```python\n  def solution(lst):\n      sum_of_odds = 0\n      for i in range(len(lst)):\n          if i % 2 == 0 and lst[i] % 2 != 0:\n              sum_of_odds += lst[i]\n      return sum_of_odds\n\n  # Test cases\n  print(solution([5, 8, 7, 1]))  # Output: 12\n  print(solution([3, 3, 3, 3, 3]))  # Output: 9\n  print(solution([30, 13, 24, 321]))  # Output: 0\n  ```\nThe code defines the function `solution` which takes a list `lst` as input and initializes a variable `sum_of_odds` to keep track of the sum of odd elements at even positions. It then iterates over the list, checking the conditions for even index and odd element value, and updates the sum accordingly.

The algorithm involves the following steps:\n1. Check if the date string is in the correct format.\n2. Parse the date string into its components (month, day, year).\n3. Validate the month, day, and year according to the given rules.\n\n## Tutorial:\nTo validate a date string in Python, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Check the Format**: Ensure the date string matches the expected format `mm-dd-yyyy`. This can be done using string methods or regular expressions.\n\n2. **Parse the Date**: Split the date string into month, day, and year components. Convert these components into integers for further validation.\n\n3. **Validate Month**: Check if the month is within the range of 1 to 12.\n\n4. **Validate Day**: Depending on the month, check if the day is within the valid range. For example, April (month 4) should have a day between 1 and 30.\n\n5. **Leap Year Consideration**: If the month is February (month 2), you may need to check if the year is a leap year to determine if the day can be 29.\n\n6. **Validate Year**: Optionally, you can also validate the year if there are specific constraints on it.\n\nFor leap year calculation, a year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4, except for end-of-century years, which must be divisible by 400. This means that the year 2000 was a leap year, whereas 1900 was not.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Check if a Year is Leap Year**: Given a year, determine whether it is a leap year or not.\n   - Solution: Check if the year is divisible by 4 but not by 100, or it is divisible by 400.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def is_leap_year(year):\n         return (year % 4 == 0 and year % 100 != 0) or (year % 400 == 0)\n     ```\n\n2. **Calculate the Day of the Week for a Given Date**: Given a date, calculate what day of the week it falls on.\n   - Solution: Use Zeller's Congruence or other algorithms to calculate the day of the week.\n   - Python3 code: (This would be a bit complex to include here, but there are libraries like `datetime` that can do this.)\n\n3. **Date Difference**: Given two dates, calculate the number of days between them.\n   - Solution: Convert both dates to Julian Day Numbers and subtract them to find the difference.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     from datetime import datetime\n     def date_difference(date1, date2):\n         d1 = datetime.strptime(date1, \"%m-%d-%Y\")\n         d2 = datetime.strptime(date2, \"%m-%d-%Y\")\n         return abs((d2 - d1).days)\n     ```\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n- Explanation of the solution:\n  The solution involves checking the format of the date string, parsing the date into month, day, and year, and then validating each component based on the rules provided.\n\n- Python3 code to solve the problem:\n  ```python\n  def valid_date(date):\n      # Check if the date is in the correct format\n      if len(date) != 10 or date[2] != '-' or date[5] != '-':\n          return False\n      \n      # Split the date into components\n      parts = date.split('-')\n      if len(parts) != 3:\n          return False\n      \n      month, day, year = parts\n      \n      # Validate month\n      if not month.isdigit() or not 1 <= int(month) <= 12:\n          return False\n      \n      # Validate day\n      if not day.isdigit() or not 1 <= int(day):\n          return False\n      \n      month = int(month)\n      day = int(day)\n      thirty_day_months = {4, 6, 9, 11}\n      \n      if month in thirty_day_months and day > 30:\n          return False\n      elif month == 2:  # February\n          if day > 29:\n              return False\n      elif day > 31:\n          return False\n      \n      # Validate year\n      if not year.isdigit() or len(year) != 4:\n          return False\n      \n      return True\n\n  # Test cases\n  print(valid_date('03-11-2000'))  # True\n  print(valid_date('15-01-2012'))  # False\n  print(valid_date('04-0-2040'))   # False\n  print(valid_date('06-04-2020'))  # True\n  print(valid_date('06/04/2020'))  # False\n  ```\n\nThis code checks the format of the date string, splits it into components, and validates each part according to the rules.

The core concepts involved are:\n1. String splitting based on delimiters.\n2. Character encoding and ordinal values.\n3. Conditional logic to apply different operations based on the input string.\n\n## Tutorial:\n### String Splitting:\nIn Python, strings can be split into a list of substrings using the `split()` method. By default, `split()` uses any whitespace as the delimiter, but you can specify a different delimiter if needed.\n\n```python\ntext = \"Hello world!\"\nwords = text.split()  # Splits on whitespace\nprint(words)  # Output: ['Hello', 'world!']\n\ncsv_text = \"Hello,world!\"\nwords = csv_text.split(',')  # Splits on comma\nprint(words)  # Output: ['Hello', 'world!']\n```\n\n### Character Encoding and Ordinal Values:\nEach character in a string has an associated ordinal value, which is its position in the character encoding scheme. In Python, the `ord()` function returns the Unicode code point for a given character.\n\n```python\nprint(ord('a'))  # Output: 97\nprint(ord('b'))  # Output: 98\n```\n\n### Conditional Logic:\nConditional statements in Python, such as `if`, `elif`, and `else`, allow you to execute different blocks of code based on certain conditions.\n\n```python\nx = 10\nif x > 5:\n    print(\"x is greater than 5\")\nelif x == 5:\n    print(\"x is equal to 5\")\nelse:\n    print(\"x is less than 5\")\n```\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **String Tokenization**: Given a string and a delimiter, split the string into tokens without using the built-in `split()` method.\n2. **Counting Specific Characters**: Count the number of vowels in a given string.\n3. **Custom String Parsing**: Parse a log file where each entry is separated by a semicolon and extract specific fields.\n\nFor each of these problems, the solution would involve iterating over the string, checking for specific conditions, and using string methods or character ordinal values to achieve the desired result.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n### Explanation of the solution:\nThe solution involves checking for the presence of whitespaces or commas in the input string and splitting the string accordingly. If neither is present, we count the number of lowercase letters with odd ordinal values (i.e., 'a', 'c', 'e', ..., 'y').\n\n### Python3 code to solve the problem:\n```python\ndef split_words(txt):\n    # Check if there are whitespaces and split on them\n    if ' ' in txt:\n        return txt.split()\n    # Check if there are commas and split on them\n    elif ',' in txt:\n        return txt.split(',')\n    else:\n        # Count the number of lowercase letters with odd order in the alphabet\n        return sum(1 for char in txt if char.islower() and (ord(char) - ord('a')) % 2 == 0)\n\n# Test cases\nprint(split_words(\"Hello world!\"))  # \u279e [\"Hello\", \"world!\"]\nprint(split_words(\"Hello,world!\"))  # \u279e [\"Hello\", \"world!\"]\nprint(split_words(\"abcdef\"))        # == 3\n```\n\nThis code will correctly handle the given examples and should work for any input string according to the problem's specifications."], "prompt_tokens": [304], "completion_tokens": [715], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": false, "language": "Python3"}

Initialize a variable to keep track of the previous number in the list. For the first iteration, you can set it to the first element of the list or to a value that is less than the minimum possible value in the list (since the problem assumes no negative numbers, you could initialize it to -1).\n\n2.

If it is not, the list is not sorted in ascending order, and you can return False.\n\n4. Also, check if the current element is the same as the previous element.

This is a classic dynamic programming problem where you maintain an array to keep track of the longest increasing subsequence ending at each index.\n\n3. **Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array**: Given a sorted array, remove the duplicates in-place such that each element appears only once and return the new length.

Interval Intersection: Determining the common part of two given intervals.\n2. Primality Test: Checking if a number is prime.\n\n## Tutorial:\n\n### Interval Intersection:\nTo find the intersection of two intervals `(a, b)` and `(c, d)`, we need to find the maximum of the start points `max(a, c)` and the minimum of the end points `min(b, d)`. If the maximum start point is less than or equal to the minimum end point, the intervals intersect, and the intersection is given by `(max(a, c), min(b, d))`. If not, the intervals do not intersect.\n\n### Primality Test:\nA prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. To check if a number `n` is prime, we can iterate from `2` to `sqrt(n)` and check if `n` is divisible by any number in this range. If it is, `n` is not prime; otherwise, it is prime.\n\n## Example Problems:\n\n1. **Merge Intervals**: Given a collection of intervals, merge all overlapping intervals. The solution involves sorting the intervals based on their start times and then merging overlapping intervals by comparing the end of one interval to the start of the next.\n\n2. **Non-overlapping Intervals**: Given a collection of intervals, find the minimum number of intervals you need to remove to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping. This problem can be solved by first sorting the intervals by their end times and then greedily selecting intervals that do not overlap with the previously selected one.\n\n3. **Count Primes**: Count the number of prime numbers less than a non-negative number `n`.

DFS is a common algorithm used in grid-based problems to explore all possible paths from a given starting point. Pruning is used to avoid unnecessary computations by cutting off branches of the search tree that won't lead to an optimal solution.\n\n## Tutorial:\nDepth-First Search (DFS) is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. The algorithm starts at the root node (selecting some arbitrary node as the root in the case of a graph) and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.\n\nHere's a high-level overview of how DFS works:\n1. Start at the root node (or any arbitrary node in the case of a graph).\n2. Mark the node as visited and add it to the path.\n3. For each neighbor of the current node that has not been visited:\n   - Recursively apply DFS to that neighbor.\n4. If the end condition is met (e.g., path length equals `k`), check if the current path is the minimum lexicographically.\n5. Backtrack to explore other paths.\n6. Continue the process until all paths of length `k` have been explored.\n\nPruning is a technique used to enhance the efficiency of DFS. It involves stopping the recursive exploration of a path when it's clear that the path cannot possibly lead to an optimal solution. In the context of this problem, pruning can be applied if the current path cannot be lexicographically smaller than the best path found so far.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Knight's Tour Problem**: Given an N x N chessboard, find a knight's tour that visits every square exactly once. The solution involves using DFS to explore all possible moves of the knight and backtracking when a move doesn't lead to a solution.\n\n2. **Word Search**: Given a 2D grid of letters and a word, find if the word exists in the grid. The word can be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cells, where \"adjacent\" cells are horizontally or vertically neighboring. DFS is used to explore all possible paths that can form the word.\n\n3. **Number of Islands**: Given a 2D grid map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), count the number of islands. An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically.

The Tribonacci sequence is a variation of the Fibonacci sequence, where each term is the sum of the three preceding ones, instead of two.\n\n## Tutorial:\nRecursion involves the concept of a function calling itself with a smaller input. In the case of the Tribonacci sequence, we have a base case for `tri(1)` and a recursive case for other values of `n`. When `n` is even, the value is given by a simple formula, but when `n` is odd, we need to calculate the values of `tri(n-1)`, `tri(n-2)`, and `tri(n+1)` recursively.\n\nTo implement recursion efficiently, we often use memoization to store the results of subproblems so that we don't have to recompute them each time they are needed. This is especially important in sequences like Tribonacci, where the same values are needed multiple times.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Fibonacci Sequence**: Given `n`, calculate the `n`-th Fibonacci number. The Fibonacci sequence is defined by `F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)` with base cases `F(0) = 0` and `F(1) = 1`. This can be solved using recursion with memoization.\n\n2. **Climbing Stairs**: You are climbing a staircase. It takes `n` steps to reach the top. Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top? This problem is similar to the Fibonacci sequence and can be solved with dynamic programming.\n\n3. **House Robber**: You are a robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, the only constraint stopping you from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security systems connected, and it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night. This problem can be solved using dynamic programming, where the solution to the problem depends on the solutions to smaller subproblems.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\nWe will use a list to store the Tribonacci numbers as we calculate them.

Initialize a variable to store the product of odd digits. Set it to 1 initially.\n2. Loop through each digit in the number:\n   - If the number is 0, break the loop as there are no more digits to process.\n   - Extract the last digit of the number using the modulo operator (`n % 10`).\n   - Check if the digit is odd (using `digit % 2 != 0`).\n   - If it is odd, multiply it with the product variable.\n   - Remove the last digit from the number by doing integer division by 10 (`n // 10`).\n3. After the loop, check if the product is still 1, which means there were no odd digits. If so, return 0.\n4.

When you encounter an opening bracket, push it onto the stack.\n2. When you encounter a closing bracket, check if the stack is not empty and if the top element is a matching opening bracket. If it is, pop the top element from the stack; otherwise, the sequence is invalid.\n3. After processing the entire string, if the stack is empty, the sequence is valid; otherwise, it is invalid.\n\nFor the specific problem of checking for nested brackets, you need to modify the algorithm slightly to ensure that at least one bracket is nested within another.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Balanced Parentheses**: Given a string containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.

The algorithm involves two main steps for each number in the list:\n1. Rounding up to the nearest integer (ceiling).\n2. Squaring the rounded number.\n\n## Tutorial:\nTo solve this problem, we need to understand two built-in Python functions: `math.ceil()` and the exponentiation operator `**`.\n\n1. `math.ceil(x)` - This function returns the smallest integer greater than or equal to `x`. If `x` is already an integer, it returns `x`. This function is part of the `math` module, so you need to import it before using it.\n\n2. `x ** y` - This is the exponentiation operator in Python, which returns `x` raised to the power of `y`.\n\nThe algorithm for solving the problem is as follows:\n- Import the `math` module to use the `ceil` function.\n- Iterate over each number in the list.\n- Apply `math.ceil()` to round each number up to the nearest integer.\n- Square the rounded number by using the exponentiation operator `**` with 2.\n- Sum all the squared numbers.\n- Return the sum.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Rounding Grades**: Students receive grades in the form of floating-point numbers. Write a function that rounds each grade up to the nearest integer divisible by 5 if the difference between the grade and the next multiple of 5 is less than 3, and it's greater than or equal to 38. Otherwise, the grade stays the same.\n\n   Solution: Iterate through each grade, check the conditions, and apply rounding only when necessary. Use the modulo operator `%` to find the difference to the next multiple of 5.\n\n2. **Finding the Next Square**: Given a positive integer, write a function that returns the next square if the number is a square, -1 otherwise.\n\n   Solution: First, check if the number is a perfect square by taking the square root and checking if it's an integer. If it is, add 1 to the square root and square it to get the next square. Otherwise, return -1.\n\n3. **Minimize Sum Of Array**: Given an array of integers, write a function that returns the minimum possible sum by multiplying two numbers and replacing them with their product, done exactly once.\n\n   Solution: Find the two smallest numbers in the array, multiply them, and replace one of them with the product while removing the other. Then, sum the modified array.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef sum_squares(lst):\n    # Sum the squares of the ceiling of each number in the list\n    return sum(math.ceil(num) ** 2 for num in lst)\n\n# Examples\nprint(sum_squares([1, 2, 3]))  # Output: 14\nprint(sum_squares([1, 4, 9]))  # Output: 98\nprint(sum_squares([1, 3, 5, 7]))  # Output: 84\nprint(sum_squares([1.4, 4.2, 0]))  # Output: 29\nprint(sum_squares([-2.4, 1, 1]))  # Output: 6\n```\n\n- Explanation of the solution:\nThe solution uses a list comprehension to iterate over each number in the input list. For each number, it applies the `math.ceil()` function to round it up to the nearest integer and then squares the result using the exponentiation operator `**`. The `sum()` function is then used to add up all the squared numbers, and the total sum is returned."], "prompt_tokens": [321], "completion_tokens": [766], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": false, "language": "Python3"}

Python provides a rich set of methods to handle these operations.\n\nFor this problem, we will use the following string methods:\n\n- `str.strip()`: This method returns a copy of the string with leading and trailing whitespace removed.\n- `str[-1]`: This syntax is used to access the last character of a string.\n- `str.isalpha()`: This method returns `True` if all characters in the string are alphabetic and there is at least one character, otherwise `False`.\n\nTo solve the problem, we will first check if the string is empty. If it is, we return `False`. Then, we will strip any trailing whitespace from the string. After that, we will check if the last character of the trimmed string is an alphabetical character using `isalpha()`.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Check if a string ends with a punctuation mark**: Given a string, return `True` if it ends with a punctuation mark (e.g., `.`, `?`, `!`), and `False` otherwise. The solution involves checking the last character of the string and determining if it is in a set of punctuation marks.\n\n2. **Palindrome Checker**: Given a string, write a function to check if it is a palindrome, considering only alphanumeric characters and ignoring cases. The solution involves filtering out non-alphanumeric characters and comparing the filtered string with its reverse.\n\n3. **Counting Words in a String**: Given a string, count the number of words in it.

The solution involves splitting the string by spaces and counting the resulting elements.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\n- We will first check if the string is empty.

It sequentially checks each element of the list for the target value until a match is found or until all the elements have been searched. For this problem, we are not searching for a specific target value but rather a condition where an element is less than the element before it.\n\nHere's how you would generally implement a linear search to find the first occurrence of a condition:\n1.

We can initialize a variable to `None` and update it only when we find a negative number that is larger than the current value stored in the variable.\n\nFor the smallest positive integer, we want to find the minimum value that is greater than zero.

We need to handle different types of inputs (integers, floats, and strings) and ensure that we can compare them accurately. The algorithm involves the following steps:\n1. Convert strings to floats if necessary, taking into account different decimal separators.\n2. Compare the numerical values.\n3. Return the larger value in its original type, or `None` if they are equal.\n\n## Tutorial:\nType conversion in Python is straightforward for the most part. You can convert strings to integers using `int()` and to floats using `float()`. However, when dealing with strings that represent numbers, you need to ensure that the string is in a format that can be converted to a float. For instance, Python expects the decimal point to be a period (`.`), not a comma (`,`). If the string uses a comma as a decimal separator, you'll need to replace it with a period before conversion.\n\nComparison of numbers is done using the standard comparison operators (`<`, `>`, `==`, etc.). After converting any string inputs to numbers, you can directly compare the values using these operators.\n\nHere's a brief tutorial on how to handle the conversion and comparison:\n\n```python\ndef convert_to_float(value):\n    if isinstance(value, str):\n        # Replace comma with period if it's used as a decimal separator\n        value = value.replace(',', '.')\n        return float(value)\n    return value\n\ndef compare_values(value1, value2):\n    num1 = convert_to_float(value1)\n    num2 = convert_to_float(value2)\n    \n    if num1 > num2:\n        return value1\n    elif num2 > num1:\n        return value2\n    else:\n        return None\n```\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **String to Integer Conversion**: Given a string that represents an integer, convert it to an integer without using built-in conversion functions.\n   - Solution: Iterate through each character in the string, calculate its integer value, and build the integer result.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def string_to_integer(s):\n         result = 0\n         for char in s:\n             result = result * 10 + (ord(char) - ord('0'))\n         return result\n     ```\n\n2. **Maximum of Three Values**: Given three values, return the maximum value.\n   - Solution: Compare the first two values, then compare the larger of those with the third value.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def max_of_three(a, b, c):\n         max_val = a if a > b else b\n         return max_val if max_val > c else c\n     ```\n\n3. **Sorting a List of Mixed Types**: Given a list containing integers, floats, and strings representing numbers, sort the list in ascending order.\n   - Solution: Convert all elements to floats for comparison, sort the list, and then convert back to the original types.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def sort_mixed_list(mixed_list):\n         # Convert all elements to floats for comparison\n         converted_list = [(convert_to_float(x), type(x)) for x in mixed_list]\n         # Sort by the numerical value\n         converted_list.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])\n         # Convert back to original types\n         return [x[1](x[0]) for x in converted_list]\n     ```\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\nThe solution involves converting the inputs to a common type (float) if they are strings, comparing the values, and then returning the original type of the larger value.

An even number is an integer that is divisible by 2. The sum of two even numbers is always even, and the sum of an even number of even numbers is also even.\n\nWhen we are asked to decompose a number into a sum of even numbers, we can start by considering the smallest even numbers. The smallest positive even number is 2. If we are to write a number as the sum of exactly four even numbers, the smallest sum we can get is 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 8. Therefore, any number less than 8 cannot be written as the sum of four positive even numbers.\n\nFor numbers greater than or equal to 8, we can check if they are even first. If the number is odd, it cannot be written as the sum of even numbers. If the number is even and greater than or equal to 8, it can be written as the sum of four even numbers.

Python provides a rich set of methods to work with strings, such as `replace()`, `split()`, and `join()`, which can be very handy for various string operations.\n\nIn the context of this problem, we need to handle two cases:\n1. Single space replacement: If we encounter a single space, we replace it with an underscore.\n2. Consecutive space replacement: If we encounter more than two consecutive spaces, we replace the entire sequence of spaces with a single dash.\n\nOne way to approach this problem is to iterate through the string while keeping track of the number of consecutive spaces. When we encounter a non-space character after some spaces, we decide what replacement to use based on the count of consecutive spaces.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **URLify**: Given a string, write a method to replace all spaces with `%20`. You may assume that the string has sufficient space at the end to hold the additional characters.\n   - Solution: Iterate through the string, and each time you encounter a space, replace it with `%20`.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def urlify(text):\n         return text.strip().replace(\" \", \"%20\")\n     ```\n\n2. **Compress String**: Implement a method to perform basic string compression using the counts of repeated characters. For example, the string `aabcccccaaa` would become `a2b1c5a3`.\n   - Solution: Iterate through the string, keeping track of the current character and its count. When the character changes, append the character and its count to the result.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def compress_string(s):\n         if not s:\n             return \"\"\n         result = []\n         count = 1\n         for i in range(1, len(s)):\n             if s[i] == s[i-1]:\n                 count += 1\n             else:\n                 result.append(s[i-1] + str(count))\n                 count = 1\n         result.append(s[-1] + str(count))\n         return ''.join(result)\n     ```\n\n3. **Reverse Words in a String**: Given an input string, reverse the string word by word.\n   - Solution: Split the string by spaces, reverse the list of words, and then join them back together with a space.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def reverse_words(s):\n         return ' '.join(reversed(s.split()))\n     ```\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n- Explanation of the solution:\n  We will iterate through the string, keeping track of the number of consecutive spaces. When we encounter a non-space character, we check the count of consecutive spaces and replace them accordingly. We use a list to build the new string for efficiency.\n\n- Python3 code:\n  ```python\n  def fix_spaces(text):\n      result = []\n      space_count = 0\n      \n      for char in text:\n          if char == ' ':\n              space_count += 1\n          else:\n              if space_count > 0:\n                  if space_count > 2:\n                      result.append('-')\n                  else:\n                      result.extend(['_'] * space_count)\n              space_count = 0\n              result.append(char)\n      \n      # Handle trailing spaces\n      if space_count > 2:\n          result.append('-')\n      else:\n          result.extend(['_'] * space_count)\n      \n      return ''.join(result)\n\n  # Test cases\n  print(fix_spaces(\"Example\"))        # \"Example\"\n  print(fix_spaces(\"Example 1\"))      # \"Example_1\"\n  print(fix_spaces(\" Example 2\"))     # \"_Example_2\"\n  print(fix_spaces(\" Example   3\"))   # \"_Example-3\"\n  ```\nThis code will correctly replace single spaces with underscores and sequences of more than two spaces with a dash, as required by the problem statement."], "prompt_tokens": [270], "completion_tokens": [912], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": false, "language": "Python3"}

Python provides various methods for string manipulation, such as `split()`, `startswith()`, and `isdigit()`, which can be used to check the conditions given in the problem.\n\nRegular expressions (regex) are a powerful tool for matching patterns in text. In Python, the `re` module provides regex functionalities. A regex pattern is defined as a string that describes the constraints of the string you want to match. For example, `^[a-zA-Z]+` would match a string that starts with one or more letters.\n\nTo use regex in Python, you typically compile a pattern using `re.compile()`, and then use methods like `match()` or `search()` to find matches.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Password Validation**: Write a function to validate a password, ensuring it contains at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one digit, and one special character, and is at least 8 characters long.\n   \n   Solution: Use regular expressions to define a pattern that matches these conditions and use `re.search()` to check if the password matches the pattern.\n\n2. **Email Address Validation**: Write a function to validate an email address, ensuring it follows the format `username@domain.extension`, where `username` can contain letters, digits, hyphens, and underscores, `domain` can contain letters and digits, and `extension` can be 2 to 4 letters long.\n\n   Solution: Use regular expressions to define a pattern that matches a valid email address format and use `re.match()` to validate the email.\n\n3. **URL Parser**: Write a function to parse a URL and extract the protocol, domain, and path.\n\n   Solution: Use string methods to split the URL at the protocol separator (`://`) and further split the result to get the domain and path.

Mathematical Operations: Squaring and cubing numbers.\n\n## Tutorial:\nIteration is a fundamental concept in programming where you go through elements in a data structure, one by one. In Python, you can iterate over a list using a `for` loop or a list comprehension.\n\nConditional logic is used to execute certain code only when specific conditions are met. In Python, this is often done using `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements.\n\nIndexing refers to accessing elements in a list by their position. In Python, lists are zero-indexed, meaning the first element is at index 0.\n\nMathematical operations like squaring (raising to the power of 2) or cubing (raising to the power of 3) are performed using the `**` operator in Python.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **FizzBuzz**: Iterate over a range of numbers and print \"Fizz\" for multiples of 3, \"Buzz\" for multiples of 5, and \"FizzBuzz\" for multiples of both.

If the index is a multiple of 4 but not a multiple of 3 (i.e., `index % 4 == 0 and index % 3 != 0`), it will cube the element. Otherwise, it will leave the element unchanged.

In this problem, we are interested in prime numbers, which are numbers greater than 1 that have no positive divisors other than 1 and themselves.\n\nTo check if a number is prime, we can use a simple algorithm that tries to divide the number by all smaller numbers greater than 1.

It takes an optional `key` parameter that specifies a function to be called on each list element prior to making comparisons. The `key` function transforms each element before sorting, effectively sorting the elements as if each element had been replaced by the result of the `key` function.\n\nHere's a simple example of using a `key` function:\n\n```python\ndef custom_sort(item):\n    return len(item)  # Sort by length of items\n\nwords = ['banana', 'pie', 'apple', 'cherry']\nsorted_words = sorted(words, key=custom_sort)\nprint(sorted_words)  # Output: ['pie', 'apple', 'banana', 'cherry']\n```\n\nIn the above example, the list of words is sorted by their length, not alphabetically.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Sorting by frequency and value**: Given a list of integers, sort them according to the frequency of each number. If two numbers have the same frequency, the smaller number comes first.\n\n   Solution: Use a `key` function that returns a tuple where the first element is the frequency of the number and the second is the negative of the number (to sort in ascending order).\n\n2. **Rearrange characters by parity**: Given a string, rearrange the characters so that all even ASCII values come before odd ASCII values, while maintaining the original relative order of characters.\n\n   Solution: Use a `key` function that returns a tuple where the first element is the parity of the ASCII value of the character and the second is the index of the character in the original string.\n\n3. **Sort by closest to the average**: Given a list of numbers, sort them based on how close they are to the average of the list.\n\n   Solution: First, calculate the average of the list. Then, use a `key` function that returns the absolute difference between each number and the average.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\nThe solution involves creating a `key` function that calculates the sum of the digits of each number. Since we need to maintain the original order for numbers with the same digit sum, we can return a tuple from the `key` function where the first element is the digit sum and the second element is the index of the number in the original list.\n\nHere's the Python3 code:\n\n```python\ndef order_by_points(nums):\n    def sum_of_digits(num):\n        return sum(int(digit) for digit in str(abs(num)))  # Use abs to handle negative numbers\n\n    def sort_key(item):\n        num, index = item\n        return (sum_of_digits(num), index)\n\n    # Enumerate the list to get (number, index) pairs, sort by the key, then extract the numbers\n    return [num for num, _ in sorted(enumerate(nums), key=sort_key)]\n\n# Test cases\nprint(order_by_points([1, 11, -1, -11, -12]))  # Output: [-1, -11, 1, -12, 11]\nprint(order_by_points([]))  # Output: []\n```\n\nThis code will sort the list of numbers according to the sum of their digits while preserving the order of numbers with the same digit sum."], "prompt_tokens": [279], "completion_tokens": [769], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": false, "language": "Python3"}

This problem can be solved using a hashmap to store the cumulative sum of the elements and counting the number of times each sum occurs.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n```python\ndef get_max_triples(n):\n    # Generate the sequence based on the given formula\n    a = [i * i - i + 1 for i in range(1, n + 1)]\n    \n    # Count the frequency of each remainder when divided by 3\n    remainder_count = [0, 0, 0]\n    for value in a:\n        remainder_count[value % 3] += 1\n    \n    # Calculate the number of valid triples\n    # There are three cases for the sum to be divisible by 3:\n    # Case 1: All three elements have a remainder of 0\n    # Case 2: One element has a remainder of 0, one has 1, and one has 2\n    # Case 3: All three elements have a remainder of 1 or all have a remainder of 2\n    count = 0\n    count += remainder_count[0] * (remainder_count[0] - 1) * (remainder_count[0] - 2) // 6  # Case 1\n    count += remainder_count[0] * remainder_count[1] * remainder_count[2]  # Case 2\n    count += remainder_count[1] * (remainder_count[1] - 1) * (remainder_count[1] - 2) // 6  # Case 3\n    count += remainder_count[2] * (remainder_count[2] - 1) * (remainder_count[2] - 2) // 6  # Case 3\n    \n    return count\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(get_max_triples(5))  # Output: 1\n```\n\nExplanation of the solution:\nThe code first generates the sequence using the given formula. Then, it calculates the frequency of each remainder when the elements are divided by 3. Using these frequencies, it calculates the number of valid triples by considering the different cases where the sum of the remainders is a multiple of 3.

Filtering: Removing elements from a list based on a condition.\n2. Sorting: Arranging elements in a list in a specific order.\n\n## Tutorial:\n### Filtering:\nFiltering is the process of iterating over a collection and selecting only those elements that satisfy a given condition. In Python, this can be done using list comprehensions or the `filter()` function. For example, to filter out odd numbers from a list, you can use a list comprehension like this:\n\n```python\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\neven_numbers = [num for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0]\n```\n\n### Sorting:\nSorting is the process of arranging the elements of a list in a certain order (ascending or descending). Python provides the `sorted()` function, which returns a new sorted list, and the `.sort()` method, which sorts the list in place. You can specify the key for sorting and the order using the `key` and `reverse` parameters, respectively.\n\nFor example, to sort a list of strings by their lengths, you can use:\n\n```python\nwords = [\"banana\", \"apple\", \"cherry\"]\nsorted_words = sorted(words, key=len)\n```\n\nTo sort alphabetically after sorting by length, you can use a tuple as the key:\n\n```python\nsorted_words = sorted(words, key=lambda word: (len(word), word))\n```\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Remove Even-Length Strings from List**: Given a list of strings, remove all strings with even lengths and return the remaining list.\n   - Solution: Use a list comprehension to filter out strings with even lengths.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def remove_even_length_strings(lst):\n         return [s for s in lst if len(s) % 2 != 0]\n     ```\n\n2. **Sort Strings by Length and Alphabetically**: Given a list of strings, sort them first by length and then alphabetically.\n   - Solution: Use the `sorted()` function with a key that is a tuple of the string's length and the string itself.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def sort_by_length_and_alpha(lst):\n         return sorted(lst, key=lambda s: (len(s), s))\n     ```\n\n3. **Group Anagrams**: Given a list of strings, group anagrams together.\n   - Solution: Use a dictionary to group strings by their sorted tuple of characters.

In this problem, you can use list comprehension to filter and square the numbers in a single line of code.\n\nHere's the syntax for list comprehension:\n```python\n[expression for item in list if condition]\n```\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Filtering and Summing Even Squares**: Given a list of numbers, return the sum of squares of the even numbers.\n   - Solution: Use list comprehension to filter even numbers, square them, and then sum the result.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def sum_even_squares(lst):\n         return sum(x**2 for x in lst if x % 2 == 0)\n     ```\n\n2. **Counting Positive Integers**: Given a list of numbers, count how many are positive integers.\n   - Solution: Use a for loop to iterate through the list and an if statement to count positive integers.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def count_positive_integers(lst):\n         count = 0\n         for x in lst:\n             if isinstance(x, int) and x > 0:\n                 count += 1\n         return count\n     ```\n\n3. **Finding the Maximum Odd Number**: Given a list of numbers, find the maximum odd number. If there are no odd numbers, return None.\n   - Solution: Use list comprehension to filter odd numbers and then use the max function to find the maximum.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def max_odd_number(lst):\n         odd_numbers = [x for x in lst if x % 2 == 1]\n         return max(odd_numbers) if odd_numbers else None\n     ```\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n- Explanation of the solution:\n  The solution involves iterating through the list, checking if each number is a positive integer and odd, then squaring it and adding it to a sum.\n\n- Python3 code to solve the problem:\n  ```python\n  def double_the_difference(lst):\n      return sum(x**2 for x in lst if isinstance(x, int) and x > 0 and x % 2 == 1)\n  ```\n\nThis code uses list comprehension to filter out the numbers that are not positive integers or not odd, squares the remaining numbers, and sums them up. The `isinstance(x, int)` check ensures that we only consider integers, and `x > 0` ensures that we ignore negative numbers. The `x % 2 == 1` condition checks for odd numbers."], "prompt_tokens": [301], "completion_tokens": [769], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": false, "language": "Python3"}

A rotation of a string means taking any number of characters from the beginning of the string and moving them to the end.\n\n## Tutorial:\nTo solve this problem, we can use the following approach:\n\n1. Concatenate the second string `b` with itself. This way, we create a new string that contains all possible rotations of `b` as its substrates. For example, if `b = \"abc\"`, then `b + b = \"abcabc\"`, which includes \"abc\", \"bca\", and \"cab\" as substrates.\n\n2. Check if the first string `a` contains the second string `b` or any of its rotations as a substring. This can be done by using the `in` operator in Python, which checks for the presence of a substring within another string.\n\nThis approach works because by doubling the string `b`, we ensure that all rotations are covered. For example, if `b` is \"abc\" and we want to check for the rotation \"cab\", we can see that \"cab\" is a substring of \"abcabc\" (the doubled string).\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **String Rotation**: Given two strings, check if they are rotations of each other. The solution involves concatenating one string with itself and checking if the other string is a substring of the result.\n\n2. **Substring Check**: Given a list of strings, check if any string is a substring of another string in the list.

Return a tuple with the counts of even and odd digits.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Counting Prime Digits**: Given an integer, return the number of digits that are prime numbers.\n   - Solution: Similar to counting even and odd digits, iterate through each digit and check if it is a prime number (2, 3, 5, or 7).\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def prime_digit_count(num):\n         prime_digits = {'2', '3', '5', '7'}\n         num_str = str(abs(num))\n         count = sum(1 for digit in num_str if digit in prime_digits)\n         return count\n     ```\n\n2. **Sum of Even and Odd Digits**: Given an integer, return the sum of even digits and the sum of odd digits as a tuple.\n   - Solution: Iterate through each digit, and add it to the respective sum based on whether it's even or odd.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def sum_even_odd(num):\n         even_sum = 0\n         odd_sum = 0\n         num_str = str(abs(num))\n         for digit in num_str:\n             if int(digit) % 2 == 0:\n                 even_sum += int(digit)\n             else:\n                 odd_sum += int(digit)\n         return (even_sum, odd_sum)\n     ```\n\n3. **Palindrome Digit Count**: Given an integer, return the number of digits that form a palindrome.\n   - Solution: Convert the number to a string, and use two pointers to compare digits from the start and end, moving towards the center.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def palindrome_digit_count(num):\n         num_str = str(abs(num))\n         left, right = 0, len(num_str) - 1\n         count = 0\n         while left <= right:\n             if num_str[left] == num_str[right]:\n                 count += 1 if left == right else 2\n             left += 1\n             right -= 1\n         return count\n     ```\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n- Explanation of the solution:\n  The function `even_odd_count` takes an integer `num` as input. It first ensures the number is positive for simplicity. Then, it converts the number to a string to iterate over each digit. For each digit, it checks if it's even or odd by using the modulo operator `%` and increments the respective counter. Finally, it returns a tuple with the counts of even and odd digits.\n\n- Python3 code to solve the problem:\n  ```python\n  def even_odd_count(num):\n      even_count = 0\n      odd_count = 0\n      num_str = str(abs(num))  # Convert to string and ensure it's positive\n      for digit in num_str:\n          if int(digit) % 2 == 0:  # Check if the digit is even\n              even_count += 1\n          else:  # The digit is odd\n              odd_count += 1\n      return (even_count, odd_count)\n  ```"], "prompt_tokens": [229], "completion_tokens": [859], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": false, "language": "Python3"}

For example, multiplication and division are performed before addition and subtraction. In Python, this is also the case, and the order of operations is respected when evaluating expressions.\n\n2. **Expression Evaluation**: In Python, expressions can be evaluated using the `eval()` function, which takes a string expression and returns the result of the evaluated expression. However, for this problem, we will construct the expression manually and evaluate it step by step.\n\n3. **List Iteration**: We will iterate through the lists of operators and operands using loops. Since the operators list is one element shorter than the operands list, we need to be careful to access the elements correctly.\n\n4. **String Concatenation**: To build the algebraic expression, we will concatenate strings representing the operands and operators.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) Calculator**: Given an array of strings where each string is either an operand or an operator, evaluate the expression in Reverse Polish Notation. The solution involves using a stack to keep track of operands and applying operators as they appear.\n\n2. **Infix to Postfix Conversion**: Convert an infix algebraic expression (where operators are between operands) to postfix notation (where operators follow their operands). The solution requires understanding the precedence of operators and using a stack to reorder the elements.\n\n3. **Expression Add Operators**: Given a string that contains only digits, return all possible combinations of adding the binary operators '+', '-', or '*' between the digits so that the expression equals a given target value.

In Python, strings are immutable, meaning they cannot be changed after they are created. However, we can create new strings based on the original string.\n\nTo solve problems involving string manipulation, you often need to iterate over each character in the string and perform some operation. Python provides several methods to work with strings, such as `isalpha()` to check if a character is a letter, `isupper()` and `islower()` to check the case of a letter, and `upper()` and `lower()` to change the case of a letter.\n\nWhen reversing a string, you can use slicing with a step of -1 (`string[::-1]`), or you can use the `reversed()` function and join the characters back into a string.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **String Transformation**: Given a string, transform it by replacing each letter with the next letter in the alphabet (e.g., 'a' becomes 'b', 'z' becomes 'a'). Non-letter characters should remain unchanged.\n   Solution: Iterate over each character, check if it's a letter, and then shift it by one in the alphabet.

MD5 is a widely used hash function that produces a 128-bit hash value.\n\n## Tutorial:\nHashing is a fundamental concept in computer science and cryptography. A hash function takes an input (or 'message') and returns a fixed-size string of bytes. The output, known as the hash value or digest, is unique to each unique input. Hash functions are commonly used for ensuring data integrity, indexing data, and in various security applications.\n\nMD5 is a widely used cryptographic hash function that produces a 32-character hexadecimal number. It is commonly used to verify data integrity. MD5 has been utilized in a wide variety of security applications and is also commonly used to check the integrity of files. However, MD5 is not collision-resistant; this means that different inputs can potentially produce the same output hash. Therefore, it is not recommended to use MD5 for security-sensitive applications.\n\nIn Python, the `hashlib` module provides a simple to use interface for the MD5 hash function. Here's a quick example of how to use it:\n\n```python\nimport hashlib\n\ndef get_md5_hash(input_string):\n    # Create an MD5 hash object\n    hash_object = hashlib.md5(input_string.encode())\n    # Get the hexadecimal digest of the hash\n    hash_hex = hash_object.hexdigest()\n    return hash_hex\n```\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Password Verification**: A system stores MD5 hashes of passwords. When a user logs in, the system needs to hash the entered password and compare it to the stored hash to verify the user's identity.\n\n2. **File Integrity Check**: After downloading a file, a program can calculate the MD5 hash of the file and compare it to the hash provided by the source. If the hashes match, the file is intact and has not been tampered with.\n\n3. **Deduplication**: In a dataset with many strings, we want to remove duplicates. We can hash each string and then compare hashes to efficiently find and remove duplicates.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\nThe solution involves using the `hashlib` module to create an MD5 hash object.
