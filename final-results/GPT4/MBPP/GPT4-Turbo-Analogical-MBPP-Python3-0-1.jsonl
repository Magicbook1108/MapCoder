A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. Therefore, a non-prime number (also known as a composite number) is a natural number greater than 1 that is not prime, meaning it has at least one divisor other than 1 and itself.\n\nTo determine if a number is not prime, we can use the following algorithms:\n1. Trial Division: Test divisibility of the number `n` by all smaller natural numbers (from 2 up to `sqrt(n)`).\n2. Sieve of Eratosthenes (not directly applicable here, but useful for generating a list of primes up to a certain limit).\n\n## Tutorial:\n### Trial Division:\nThe trial division is a straightforward method to check for primality. The steps are as follows:\n1. If `n` is less than 2, it is not prime.\n2. Check if `n` is divisible by any integer from 2 to the square root of `n`. The square root is used as a limit because if `n` is divisible by a number larger than its square root, then it must also be divisible by a number smaller than its square root.\n3. If any divisor is found, `n` is not prime. Otherwise, it is prime.\n\n### Sieve of Eratosthenes:\nWhile not directly used for checking a single number's primality, the Sieve of Eratosthenes is an efficient algorithm to find all prime numbers up to a given limit. It works by iteratively marking the multiples of each prime number starting from 2.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Problem: Check for Prime Numbers**\n   Given a list of numbers, determine which ones are prime.\n   Solution: Use the trial division method for each number in the list.\n   Python3 code:\n   ```python\n   def is_prime(n):\n       if n <= 1:\n           return False\n       for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):\n           if n % i == 0:\n               return False\n       return True\n\n   numbers = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\n   primes = [num for num in numbers if is_prime(num)]\n   ```\n\n2. **Problem: Sum of Primes**\n   Find the sum of all prime numbers below a given number `N`.\n   Solution: Use the Sieve of Eratosthenes to generate primes and then sum them.\n   Python3 code:\n   ```python\n   def sum_of_primes(limit):\n       sieve = [True] * limit\n       sieve[0] = sieve[1] = False\n       for i in range(2, int(limit**0.5) + 1):\n           if sieve[i]:\n               for j in range(i*i, limit, i):\n                   sieve[j] = False\n       return sum(i for i in range(limit) if sieve[i])\n\n   print(sum_of_primes(2000000))\n   ```\n\n3. **Problem: Least Prime Factor**\n   For each number in a list, find the smallest prime factor.\n   Solution: Use trial division to find the smallest prime factor.\n   Python3 code:\n   ```python\n   def least_prime_factor(n):\n       if n <= 1:\n           return None\n       for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):\n           if n % i == 0:\n               return i\n       return n\n\n   numbers = [10, 15, 21, 29, 30]\n   factors = [least_prime_factor(num) for num in numbers]\n   ```\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n### Explanation of the solution:\nTo solve the original problem, we will use the trial division method. We will iterate from 2 to the square root of `n` and check if `n` is divisible by any of these numbers. If it is, then `n` is not prime, and we return `True`. If no divisors are found, we return `False`.\n\n### Python3 code to solve the problem:\n```python\ndef is_not_prime(n: int) -> bool:\n    if n <= 1:\n        return True  # 0 and 1 are not prime numbers\n    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            return True  # Found a divisor, so n is not prime\n    return False  # No divisors found, n is prime, but we want non-prime\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(is_not_prime(10))  # True, because 10 is not a prime number\nprint(is_not_prime(13))  # False, because 13 is a prime number\n```\nThis code will correctly identify non-prime numbers as per the given problem statement."], "prompt_tokens": [195], "completion_tokens": [1056], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": true, "task_id": "mbpp_3_is_not_prime"}

A heap is a specialized tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property. In a max-heap, for any given node I, the value of I is greater than or equal to the values of its children. Python provides a built-in module `heapq` which can be used to implement a min-heap. To use it as a max-heap, we can insert the negation of the numbers.\n\n## Tutorial:\nHeaps are commonly used for priority queues, where the queue retrieves the element with the highest (or lowest) priority first. In Python, the `heapq` module provides functions for implementing heaps based on regular lists.\n\nHere's a brief tutorial on using the `heapq` module:\n\n1. `heapq.heapify(x)`: This function transforms list `x` into a heap, in-place, in linear time.\n\n2. `heapq.heappush(heap, item)`: This function pushes a new item onto the heap, maintaining the heap invariant.\n\n3. `heapq.heappop(heap)`: This function pops the smallest item off the heap, maintaining the heap invariant. If the heap is empty, IndexError is raised.\n\n4. `heapq.nlargest(n, iterable)`: This function returns a list with the n largest elements from the dataset defined by iterable.\n\n5. `heapq.nsmallest(n, iterable)`: This function returns a list with the n smallest elements from the dataset defined by iterable.\n\nFor the max-heap functionality, we can insert the negation of the numbers and then negate them again when retrieving.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Kth Largest Element in a Stream**: Maintain a stream of numbers and find the kth largest element at any point.

Specifically, we will use the XOR (`^`) operation, which can be used to identify the positions at which two numbers differ in their binary representation.\n\n## Tutorial:\nBitwise operations are a fundamental part of computer science and are used to manipulate individual bits of a number. The XOR operation is particularly useful for comparing bits. When you perform an XOR operation between two bits, the result is `1` if the bits are different, and `0` if they are the same.\n\nHere's the truth table for XOR:\n\n```\nA B | A XOR B\n0 0 |   0\n0 1 |   1\n1 0 |   1\n1 1 |   0\n```\n\nTo solve the problem of checking if two numbers differ at exactly one bit position, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Perform an XOR operation between the two numbers. This will give us a number where all the bits that are different between `a` and `b` are set to `1`.\n2. Check if the result of the XOR operation is a power of two. If it is, then `a` and `b` differ at exactly one bit position. This is because a power of two in binary representation has only one bit set to `1`.\n\nTo check if a number is a power of two, we can use the fact that a power of two minus one has all the bits set to `1` right before the bit that is `1` in the power of two. Therefore, `(number & (number - 1))` will be `0` if `number` is a power of two.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Counting Bits**: Given a non-negative integer `num`, return the number of steps to reduce it to zero. At each step, if the current number is even, you have to divide it by 2, otherwise, subtract 1 from it. The solution involves using bitwise operations to check if the least significant bit is `1` or `0`.\n\n2. **Single Number**: Given a non-empty array of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one. The solution is to use XOR operation across all elements. The property of XOR is that `a XOR a = 0` and `a XOR 0 = a`. Therefore, XORing all numbers will cancel out the ones that appear twice, leaving the unique number.\n\n3. **Hamming Distance**: The Hamming distance between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different. Given two integers, we can calculate the Hamming distance by performing an XOR operation and then counting the number of `1` bits in the result.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n```python\ndef differ_At_One_Bit_Pos(a: int, b: int) -> bool:\n    # Perform XOR operation to find differing bits\n    xor_result = a ^ b\n    # Check if xor_result is a power of two (only one bit is set to 1)\n    return xor_result and not (xor_result & (xor_result - 1))\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(differ_At_One_Bit_Pos(10, 12))  # Output: False (10 is 1010, 12 is 1100 in binary)\nprint(differ_At_One_Bit_Pos(10, 14))  # Output: True (10 is 1010, 14 is 1110 in binary)\n```\n\n- Explanation of the solution:\nThe function `differ_At_One_Bit_Pos` first calculates the XOR of `a` and `b`. If `a` and `b` differ at exactly one bit position, the result will be a power of two. The function then checks if the result is non-zero and if it is a power of two by verifying that `xor_result & (xor_result - 1)` is zero. If both conditions are met, it returns `True`, indicating that `a` and `b` differ at exactly one bit position. Otherwise, it returns `False`."], "prompt_tokens": [210], "completion_tokens": [853], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": true, "task_id": "mbpp_6_differ_At_One_Bit_Pos"}

The original string \"abcde\" reappears at index 5 of the concatenated string.

Returns `-1` if the substring is not found.\n- Slicing: Strings can be sliced using the syntax `string[start:end]`, which returns a new string containing characters from index `start` to `end-1`. If `start` or `end` is negative, it counts from the end of the string.\n\nTo remove a character at a specific index, we can slice the string into two parts: one before the index and one after the index, and then concatenate them together.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Remove All Occurrences of a Substring**: Given a string `s` and a substring `part`, repeatedly remove occurrences of `part` from `s` until `part` is no longer in `s`, and return the final string.\n\n   Solution: Use a loop to find and remove occurrences of `part` using `str.replace(part, '', 1)` until `part` is not found.\n\n2. **Backspace String Compare**: Given two strings `s` and `t`, return `True` if they are equal when both are typed into empty text editors. `#` means a backspace character.\n\n   Solution: Process the strings from end to start, keeping track of backspaces, and build the resulting strings to compare.\n\n3. **Implement strStr()**: Return the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack, or `-1` if needle is not part of haystack.\n\n   Solution: Use the `str.find()` method to find the first occurrence of the needle in the haystack.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\nTo solve the original problem, we will find the index of the first and last occurrence of the character `ch` in the string `s`. Then, we will remove the character at those indices by slicing the string accordingly.\n\n```python\ndef remove_Occ(s: str, ch: str) -> str:\n    # Find the index of the first occurrence of ch\n    first_index = s.find(ch)\n    if first_index == -1:\n        # Character not found, return the original string\n        return s\n    \n    # Remove the first occurrence of ch\n    s = s[:first_index] + s[first_index+1:]\n    \n    # Find the index of the last occurrence of ch\n    last_index = s.rfind(ch)\n    if last_index == -1:\n        # Character not found, return the string without the first occurrence\n        return s\n    \n    # Remove the last occurrence of ch\n    s = s[:last_index] + s[last_index+1:]\n    \n    return s\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(remove_Occ(\"hello world\", \"l\"))  # Output: \"heo world\"\n```\n\nIn this code, we use `str.find()` to locate the first occurrence of `ch` and `str.rfind()` to locate the last occurrence. We then create a new string without these characters by slicing the string before and after the found indices and concatenating the slices. If the character `ch` is not found, the original string is returned without modification."], "prompt_tokens": [206], "completion_tokens": [813], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": true, "task_id": "mbpp_11_remove_Occ"}

In Python, the `sorted` function allows us to sort iterables based on a key function that we can define.

The `sorted` function returns a new sorted list, while the `sort` method sorts the list in place. When sorting objects or complex data structures, you often need to specify the criteria for sorting, which is where the `key` parameter comes into play.\n\nThe `key` parameter of the `sorted` function and the `sort` method expects a function that takes a single argument and returns a value to use for sorting purposes. This value does not need to be a single field; it can be a tuple of fields or any value derived from the object.\n\nFor example, if you have a list of tuples where each tuple represents a student's name and grade, and you want to sort the list by grades, you can do the following:\n\n```python\nstudents = [('Alice', 88), ('Bob', 75), ('Charlie', 90)]\nsorted_students = sorted(students, key=lambda student: student[1])\n```\n\nIn this case, `lambda student: student[1]` is the key function that returns the grade of each student, which is used for sorting.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Sorting Tuples by Second Value**: Given a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers, sort the list based on the second value of each tuple in ascending order.\n   - Solution: Use the `sorted` function with a key function that returns the second element of each tuple.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def sort_tuples(tuples_list):\n         return sorted(tuples_list, key=lambda x: x[1])\n     ```\n\n2. **Sorting Strings by Length**: Given a list of strings, sort the list in ascending order based on the length of each string.\n   - Solution: Use the `sorted` function with a key function that returns the length of each string.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def sort_strings_by_length(strings_list):\n         return sorted(strings_list, key=len)\n     ```\n\n3. **Sorting Objects by Multiple Attributes**: Suppose you have a list of objects representing employees, and each employee has a name and an age attribute. You want to sort the employees first by age and then by name.\n   - Solution: Use the `sorted` function with a key function that returns a tuple consisting of the age and name.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     class Employee:\n         def __init__(self, name, age):\n             self.name = name\n             self.age = age\n\n     def sort_employees(employees):\n         return sorted(employees, key=lambda e: (e.age, e.name))\n     ```\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n- Explanation of the solution:\n  To solve the original problem, we will use the `sorted` function with a key function that calculates the sum of each row in the matrix.

Python provides a rich set of methods to handle string manipulation tasks.\n\nSet operations are also commonly used in programming. A set is a collection of unique elements. Python sets support operations like union, intersection, difference, and symmetric difference.\n\nIn the context of this problem, we can use a set to store the characters of the second string. This allows us to efficiently check if a character from the first string is in the second string, as set lookup operations are generally faster than list or string lookups.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide to the algorithm:\n1. Convert the second string into a set of characters.\n2. Iterate over the characters in the first string.\n3. For each character, check if it is not in the set of characters from the second string.\n4. If it is not in the set, append it to the result string.\n5. Return the result string.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Unique Email Addresses**: Given a list of email addresses, each email consists of a local name and a domain name, separated by the @ sign. However, the local name may contain dots or plus signs. If you add periods ('.') within the local name, mail sent there will be forwarded to the same address without dots in the local name. Plus signs ('+') in the local name mean that everything after the first plus sign will be ignored. Implement a function to count the number of different addresses that actually receive mails.\n\n   Solution: Normalize each email address according to the rules and then use a set to count unique addresses.\n\n2. **Jewels and Stones**: You're given strings `J` representing the types of stones that are jewels, and `S` representing the stones you have. Each character in `S` is a type of stone you have. You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.\n\n   Solution: Convert `J` into a set and then count how many characters in `S` are in that set.\n\n3. **Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters**: Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.\n\n   Solution: Use a sliding window approach to maintain a set of characters currently in the window and expand or shrink the window based on whether the next character is already in the set.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\nWe will create a set from the second string to store the characters that need to be removed. Then, we will iterate over the first string and construct a new string by including only those characters that are not in the set.\n\n```python\ndef remove_dirty_chars(string: str, second_string: str) -> str:\n    # Create a set of characters to be removed\n    remove_set = set(second_string)\n    \n    # Build the result string with characters not in the remove_set\n    result = ''.join(char for char in string if char not in remove_set)\n    \n    return result\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(remove_dirty_chars(\"hello world\", \"ad\"))  # Output: \"hello worl\"\n```\n\nThe function `remove_dirty_chars` takes two strings as input and returns a new string with the specified characters removed.

The core concepts include:\n\n1. Brute Force Method: Compare each element with every other element.\n2. Sorting: Sort the array and then check for consecutive duplicate elements.\n3. Hashing: Use a hash set to keep track of the elements we have seen.\n\n## Tutorial:\n### Brute Force Method:\nThis is the simplest approach where you take each element and compare it with every other element in the array. The time complexity of this method is O(n^2), which is not efficient for large arrays.\n\n### Sorting:\nFirst, sort the array using an efficient sorting algorithm like quicksort or mergesort, which typically have O(n log n) complexity. After sorting, you can scan the array from left to right and check if there are any consecutive elements that are the same. This method improves the time complexity to O(n log n) due to the sorting step.\n\n### Hashing:\nHashing is the most efficient method for this problem. You can iterate through the array and insert each element into a hash set. Before inserting, you check if the element is already present in the set. If it is, you've found a duplicate and can return true. Otherwise, you insert the element into the set. The average time complexity for this method is O(n), assuming that the hash function distributes the elements uniformly.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Two Sum**: Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`. This problem can be solved using hashing by storing the complement of each element and checking if it exists in the hash table.\n\n2. **Longest Consecutive Sequence**: Given an unsorted array of integers `nums`, return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence. This can be solved using a hash set to store all elements and then iterate through the array, checking for the longest consecutive sequence.\n\n3. **Contains Duplicate II**: Given an array of integers and an integer `k`, find out whether there are two distinct indices `i` and `j` in the array such that `nums[i] = nums[j]` and the absolute difference between `i` and `j` is at most `k`. This problem can be solved using a hash map to store the element as the key and its index as the value.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n### Explanation of the solution:\nWe will use the hashing method to solve this problem. We will iterate through the array and use a set to keep track of the elements we have seen. If we encounter an element that is already in the set, we return `True` as we have found a duplicate. If we finish iterating through the array without finding a duplicate, we return `False`.\n\n### Python3 code to solve the problem:\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef test_duplicate(arraynums: List[int]) -> bool:\n    seen = set()\n    for num in arraynums:\n        if num in seen:\n            return True\n        seen.add(num)\n    return False\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(test_duplicate([1, 2, 3, 4]))  # Output: False\nprint(test_duplicate([1, 2, 3, 2]))  # Output: True\n```\n\nThis code defines the function `test_duplicate` which takes a list of integers and returns a boolean indicating whether any duplicates exist in the list.

To check if a number `x` is a Woodall number, we need to find an integer `n` such that `x = n * 2^n - 1`.\n\n## Tutorial:\nTo determine if a number `x` is a Woodall number, we can use the following approach:\n\n1. Start with `n = 1` and calculate `n * 2^n - 1`.\n2. If the result is equal to `x`, then `x` is a Woodall number.\n3. If the result is greater than `x`, then `x` is not a Woodall number because the function `n * 2^n - 1` is strictly increasing for `n > 0`.\n4. If the result is less than `x`, increment `n` and repeat the process.\n\nThis approach is based on the fact that for each `n`, there is only one Woodall number, and the sequence of Woodall numbers is strictly increasing. Therefore, we can iterate through the sequence until we either find the number or surpass it.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Checking for Mersenne Numbers**: A Mersenne number is a number of the form `2^p - 1` for some integer `p`.

The problem is to find all perfect numbers up to a given limit. The solution often involves checking if `2^(p-1) * (2^p - 1)` is a perfect number, where `2^p - 1` is a Mersenne prime.\n\n3. **Catalan Numbers**: A Catalan number is a number that arises in various counting problems, often involving recursively-defined structures. The problem is to find the `n`-th Catalan number. The solution involves using the formula `C(n) = (2n)! / ((n+1)! * n!)`.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\nTo solve the original problem, we will implement the approach described above.

If the former is greater, then `a` should come before `b` in the sorted array.\n\nOnce we have the correct comparison mechanism, we can use a sorting algorithm (like quicksort, mergesort, etc.) to sort the array based on our custom comparison.

Specifically, we can use the sign bit of the integers to quickly check if they differ. In most computer systems, integers are represented using two's complement binary form, where the most significant bit (MSB) is the sign bit. If the sign bit is 0, the number is non-negative; if it is 1, the number is negative.\n\n## Tutorial:\nBit manipulation involves directly manipulating bits within binary representations of data. It is a powerful tool in programming, allowing for efficient computations and compact storage of information. Here are some common bit manipulation operations:\n\n1. **AND (`&`)**: When applied to two bits, it returns 1 if both bits are 1, otherwise 0.\n2. **OR (`|`)**: When applied to two bits, it returns 1 if at least one of the bits is 1.\n3. **XOR (`^`)**: When applied to two bits, it returns 1 if the bits are different, otherwise 0.\n4. **NOT (`~`)**: When applied to a bit, it inverts the bit (0 becomes 1, and 1 becomes 0).\n5. **Bit Shifts (`<<` and `>>`)**: Shifts the bits of a number to the left or right by a certain number of positions, which is equivalent to multiplying or dividing by a power of 2, respectively.\n\nTo check if two integers have opposite signs, we can use the XOR operation.

Find that single one.\n   - Solution: Use XOR operation across all elements. The property of XOR is that a^a=0 and a^0=a. Therefore, all pairs will cancel out, leaving the single number.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def singleNumber(nums: List[int]) -> int:\n         result = 0\n         for num in nums:\n             result ^= num\n         return result\n     ```\n\n3. **Power of Two**: Given an integer, write a function to determine if it is a power of two.\n   - Solution: A number is a power of two if it has exactly one bit set to 1 in its binary representation. We can check this by turning off the rightmost 1-bit and checking if the result is 0.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def isPowerOfTwo(n: int) -> bool:\n         return n > 0 and (n & (n - 1)) == 0\n     ```\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n- Explanation of the solution:\n  To determine if two integers have opposite signs, we can use the XOR operation on the sign bits of the two numbers.

This can be done using a brute force approach or with some optimization techniques.\n\n## Tutorial:\nTo solve this problem, we need to understand how to generate all substrings of a given string and how to calculate the sum of digits in a string.\n\n### Generating Substrings:\nA substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string. To generate all substrings of a string, we can use two nested loops. The outer loop will fix the starting point of the substring, and the inner loop will extend the substring to the right. For a string of length `n`, there are `n*(n+1)/2` possible substrings.\n\n### Calculating Sum of Digits:\nTo calculate the sum of digits in a string, we can iterate through each character of the string, convert it to an integer, and add it to a running total.\n\n### Brute Force Approach:\nThe brute force approach would be to generate each substring and calculate the sum of its digits, then compare it to the length of the substring. If they are equal, we increment our count.\n\n### Optimization:\nWe can optimize the brute force approach by observing that if a substring has a sum of digits equal to its length, then any non-empty prefix of that substring will also have this property. This can help us reduce the number of calculations needed.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Count Binary Substrings**: Given a binary string `s`, count the number of non-empty substrings that have the same number of 0's and 1's, and all the 0's and all the 1's in these substrings are grouped consecutively.\n   - Solution: Iterate through the string and for each group of consecutive characters, store the length of the group. Then, for each pair of consecutive groups, add the minimum of their lengths to the count.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def countBinarySubstrings(s: str) -> int:\n         groups = [1]\n         for i in range(1, len(s)):\n             if s[i] != s[i-1]:\n                 groups.append(1)\n             else:\n                 groups[-1] += 1\n         count = 0\n         for i in range(1, len(groups)):\n             count += min(groups[i-1], groups[i])\n         return count\n     ```\n\n2. **Palindrome Substring Queries**: Given a string `s` and a list of queries, where each query is a pair of indices `(left, right)`, return whether the substring `s[left:right+1]` is a palindrome.\n   - Solution: Precompute a table for palindrome checks using dynamic programming, then answer each query in constant time using the precomputed table.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def isPalindrome(s, dp, left, right):\n         if left >= right:\n             return True\n         if dp[left][right] != -1:\n             return dp[left][right]\n         dp[left][right] = (s[left] == s[right]) and isPalindrome(s, dp, left+1, right-1)\n         return dp[left][right]\n\n     def palindromeQueries(s, queries):\n         n = len(s)\n         dp = [[-1]*n for _ in range(n)]\n         result = []\n         for left, right in queries:\n             result.append(isPalindrome(s, dp, left, right))\n         return result\n     ```\n\n3. **Maximum Subarray**: Given an integer array `nums`, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.\n   - Solution: Use Kadane's algorithm to find the maximum subarray sum in linear time.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def maxSubArray(nums):\n         max_sum = current_sum = nums[0]\n         for num in nums[1:]:\n             current_sum = max(num, current_sum + num)\n             max_sum = max(max_sum, current_sum)\n         return max_sum\n     ```\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n- Explanation of the solution:\n  We will use a brute force approach to iterate through all possible substrings of the string `s`. For each substring, we will calculate the sum of its digits and compare it to the length of the substring. If they match, we increment our count.\n\n- Python3 code to solve the problem:\n  ```python\n  def count_Substrings(s: str) -> int:\n      count = 0\n      for i in range(len(s)):\n          for j in range(i+1, len(s)+1):\n              substring = s[i:j]\n              sum_of_digits = sum(int(char) for char in substring)\n              if sum_of_digits == len(substring):\n                  count += 1\n      return count\n  ```\n\nThis code will correctly count the number of substrings where the sum of digits equals the length of the substring.

It is applicable when the problem can be divided into overlapping subproblems that can be solved independently.\n\nThe Bell Triangle is a specific application of dynamic programming used to compute Bell numbers. The triangle is constructed as follows:\n\n1. The first element of the first row is 1, which is the Bell number for `n = 0`.\n2. Each new row begins with the last element of the previous row, which represents the Bell number for the next `n`.\n3.

Two-Pass Check: Perform two separate passes, one to check for non-decreasing order and another for non-increasing order.\n\n## Tutorial:\nA monotonic array is an array where the elements are either entirely non-increasing or non-decreasing. Non-increasing means that each element is less than or equal to the previous element, and non-decreasing means that each element is greater than or equal to the previous element.\n\nTo check if an array is monotonic, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialize two boolean variables, say `increasing` and `decreasing`, to `True`.\n2. Iterate through the array from the second element to the last element.\n3. For each element, if it is smaller than the previous one, set `increasing` to `False`.\n4. Similarly, if it is larger than the previous one, set `decreasing` to `False`.\n5. If, at the end of the iteration, either `increasing` or `decreasing` is still `True`, the array is monotonic.\n\nAlternatively, we can optimize the check by stopping the iteration as soon as we find that the array is neither non-increasing nor non-decreasing.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Longest Monotonic Subsequence**: Given an array of integers, find the length of the longest monotonic subsequence.

Comb Sort is an improvement on the Bubble Sort algorithm. Like Bubble Sort, Comb Sort also involves comparing pairs of elements and swapping them if they are in the wrong order. The key difference is that Comb Sort starts by comparing elements that are far apart and gradually reduces the gap between the elements to be compared.\n\n## Tutorial:\nComb Sort is a relatively simple sorting algorithm that improves upon the Bubble Sort by eliminating turtles, or small values near the end of the list, since in a bubble sort these slow the sorting down tremendously. It works on the principle of having a variable gap between elements to be compared, which is reduced in size at each step to get closer to a gap of 1.\n\nThe steps of the Comb Sort algorithm are as follows:\n1. Choose an initial gap size. A common initial gap size is the length of the list / 1.3.\n2. Compare elements that are the gap distance apart. If they are in the wrong order, swap them.\n3. Continue this process for each pair of elements in the list separated by the gap.\n4. Once a pass through the list is completed, reduce the gap size using a shrink factor (commonly 1.3).\n5. Repeat the process with the new gap size.\n6. Continue reducing the gap size and passing through the list until the gap size is 1.\n7. Perform a final pass through the list with a gap size of 1 (this is essentially a Bubble Sort) to ensure that the list is fully sorted.\n\nThe algorithm stops when a pass through the list results in no swaps, indicating that the list is sorted.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Bubble Sort**: The classic Bubble Sort algorithm involves comparing adjacent pairs of elements and swapping them if they are in the wrong order. This process is repeated until the list is sorted. The problem with Bubble Sort is that it is very inefficient, with a worst-case time complexity of O(n^2).\n\n2. **Cocktail Shaker Sort**: This is a variation of Bubble Sort. The Cocktail Shaker Sort improves on Bubble Sort by sorting in both directions on each pass through the list. This way, both small and large elements are moved to their correct positions more quickly.\n\n3. **Shell Sort**: Shell Sort is another sorting algorithm that uses a gap to compare and sort elements. The gap starts out large and is reduced at each step, but unlike Comb Sort, Shell Sort uses an insertion sort to sort the elements within each gap.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\nThe `comb_sort` function will implement the Comb Sort algorithm. We will start with an initial gap and reduce it in each iteration using a shrink factor until the gap is 1. We will then perform a final pass to ensure the list is sorted.\n\nHere is the Python3 code to solve the problem:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef comb_sort(nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n    def next_gap(gap):\n        # Shrink factor of 1.3 as per the algorithm's standard\n        gap = (gap * 10) // 13\n        if gap < 1:\n            return 1\n        return gap\n\n    n = len(nums)\n    gap = n\n    swapped = True\n\n    while gap != 1 or swapped:\n        gap = next_gap(gap)\n        swapped = False\n\n        for i in range(n - gap):\n            if nums[i] > nums[i + gap]:\n                nums[i], nums[i + gap] = nums[i + gap], nums[i]\n                swapped = True\n\n    return nums\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(comb_sort([64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]))\n```\n\nThis code defines the `comb_sort` function, which takes a list of integers as input and returns the sorted list.

A number `n` can be expressed as the difference of two squares if and only if `n = a^2 - b^2`, where `a` and `b` are integers. This can be factored into `(a + b)(a - b) = n`. Therefore, for `n` to be represented as the difference of two squares, `n` must be expressible as the product of two integers with an even difference.\n\n## Tutorial:\nTo understand the algorithm, let's delve into some number theory. A difference of two squares is an expression of the form `a^2 - b^2`, which can be factored into `(a + b)(a - b)`. For a given number `n`, if we can find integers `a` and `b` such that `n = a^2 - b^2`, then `n` can be represented as the difference of two squares.\n\nHere's a step-by-step approach to determine if a number can be represented as the difference of two squares:\n\n1. Check if `n` is expressible as the product of two integers with an even difference.\n2. If `n` is even, it can always be expressed as the difference of two squares because `n = 2k` for some integer `k`, and we can find `a` and `b` such that `a + b = k + 1` and `a - b = k - 1`.\n3. If `n` is odd, it can be expressed as the difference of two squares if and only if it is not a multiple of 4. This is because if `n` is a multiple of 4, then both `a + b` and `a - b` would have to be even, which is not possible for odd `n`.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Sum of Two Squares**: Given a number `n`, determine if it can be expressed as the sum of two squares. This problem is similar to the difference of two squares but requires checking if there exist integers `a` and `b` such that `n = a^2 + b^2`.\n\n2. **Pythagorean Triplets**: Given a number `n`, find all Pythagorean triplets with the hypotenuse less than or equal to `n`. A Pythagorean triplet consists of three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` such that `a^2 + b^2 = c^2`. This problem involves finding squares and their relationships.\n\n3. **Fermat's Last Theorem for n=4**: Given a number `n`, check if there exist integers `a`, `b`, and `c` such that `a^4 + b^4 = c^4`. This is a specific case of Fermat's Last Theorem, which states that there are no three positive integers `a`, `b`, and `c` that can satisfy the equation `a^n + b^n = c^n` for any integer value of `n` greater than 2.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\nTo solve the original problem, we need to check if the given number `n` can be expressed as the difference of two squares.

In competitive programming, hashing is often used to solve problems that involve checking for duplicates, finding unique elements, or mapping one set of values to another.\n\nTo use hashing in Python, we typically use a dictionary, where the keys are the items we want to map, and the values are the corresponding mapped items. When checking if two lists follow the same pattern, we iterate through the lists and create a mapping from one list's items to the other's. If at any point we find that the current mapping does not match the previously stored mapping, we know that the pattern is not followed.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Isomorphic Strings**: Given two strings `s` and `t`, determine if they are isomorphic. Two strings are isomorphic if the characters in `s` can be replaced to get `t`. The solution involves creating a mapping from characters in `s` to characters in `t` and ensuring that the mapping is consistent throughout the strings.\n\n2. **Word Pattern**: Given a pattern and a string `s`, find if `s` follows the same pattern. Here pattern is a string where each letter represents a unique word in `s`. The solution is similar to the original problem, where we map pattern characters to words in `s`.\n\n3. **Find if an array follows a sequence**: Given an array and a sequence, check if the array follows the given sequence. The sequence can be represented by unique numbers, and we need to map the array elements to these numbers to check for consistency.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\nWe will iterate through both the `colors` and `patterns` lists simultaneously. For each pair of color and pattern, we will check if we have already encountered this color. If we have, we will check if the pattern it maps to is the same as the current pattern. If it is not, we return `False`. If we have not encountered the color, we will add the color-pattern pair to our mapping. We also need to ensure that two different colors are not mapped to the same pattern, which would break the one-to-one mapping requirement.\n\nHere is the Python3 code:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef is_samepatterns(colors: List[str], patterns: List[str]) -> bool:\n    if len(colors) != len(patterns):\n        return False\n    \n    color_to_pattern = {}\n    pattern_seen = set()\n    \n    for color, pattern in zip(colors, patterns):\n        if color in color_to_pattern:\n            if color_to_pattern[color] != pattern:\n                return False\n        else:\n            if pattern in pattern_seen:\n                return False\n            color_to_pattern[color] = pattern\n            pattern_seen.add(pattern)\n    \n    return True\n\n# Example usage:\ncolors = [\"red\", \"green\", \"green\"]\npatterns = [\"a\", \"b\", \"b\"]\nprint(is_samepatterns(colors, patterns))  # Output: True\n```\n\nIn this code, `color_to_pattern` is a dictionary that maps colors to patterns, and `pattern_seen` is a set that keeps track of which patterns have already been mapped to a color.

This function takes a string as an argument and returns the number of characters in the string.\n\nOnce you have the length of the string, you can determine if it is odd or even using the modulo operator `%`.

For example, \"aabcccccaaa\" would become \"a2b1c5a3\".\n   - Solution: Iterate through the string, keeping track of the current character and its count.

The number of dots in each ring after the first can be calculated by the formula \\( 6(n - 1) \\), where \\( n \\) is the ring number (starting from 1 for the first ring of 6 dots).\n\nTo find the total number of dots up to the nth ring, we sum the series:\n\\[ 1 + 6 + 12 + 18 + \\ldots + 6(n - 1) \\]\n\nThis is an arithmetic series with the first term \\( a_1 = 6 \\), common difference \\( d = 6 \\), and \\( n-1 \\) terms. The sum of the first \\( n-1 \\) terms of an arithmetic series is given by:\n\\[ S_{n-1} = \\frac{n(n - 1)}{2} \\times d \\]\n\nAdding the center dot to this sum gives us the formula for the nth centered hexagonal number:\n\\[ H_n = 1 + 6 \\times \\frac{n(n - 1)}{2} \\]\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Triangular Numbers**: Find the nth triangular number, which can be visualized as a triangle with dots. The formula for the nth triangular number is \\( T_n = \\frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \\).\n\n2. **Square Numbers**: Find the nth square number, which represents a square lattice of dots. The formula is \\( S_n = n^2 \\).\n\n3. **Pentagonal Numbers**: Find the nth pentagonal number, which represents a pattern of dots forming a pentagon. The formula is \\( P_n = \\frac{3n^2 - n}{2} \\).\n\nIn each of these problems, the solution involves deriving a formula based on the geometric pattern of the numbers and then implementing the formula to find the nth term.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\nTo solve the original problem, we will implement the formula for the nth centered hexagonal number directly in Python.\n\n```python\ndef centered_hexagonal_number(n: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    Write a function to find nth centered hexagonal number.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Using the formula for the nth centered hexagonal number\n    return 1 + 6 * (n * (n - 1) // 2)\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(centered_hexagonal_number(1))  # Output: 1\nprint(centered_hexagonal_number(2))  # Output: 7\nprint(centered_hexagonal_number(3))  # Output: 19\n```\n\nThe function `centered_hexagonal_number` takes an integer `n` and returns the nth centered hexagonal number by applying the derived formula.

This is a common operation that combines two or more dictionaries into one, where the keys and values from each dictionary are included in the resulting dictionary. If there are overlapping keys, the values from the latter dictionaries will overwrite those from the earlier ones.\n\n## Tutorial:\nMerging dictionaries can be done in several ways in Python:\n\n1. Using the `update()` method: This method updates the dictionary with elements from another dictionary object or from an iterable of key/value pairs. It does not return a new dictionary but rather updates the original dictionary.\n\n```python\ndict1 = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}\ndict2 = {'b': 3, 'c': 4}\ndict1.update(dict2)\n# Now dict1 is {'a': 1, 'b': 3, 'c': 4}\n```\n\n2. Using the `{**dict1, **dict2}` syntax: This syntax merges two dictionaries into a new one. If there are overlapping keys, the values from the second dictionary will be used.\n\n```python\nmerged_dict = {**dict1, **dict2}\n# merged_dict is {'a': 1, 'b': 3, 'c': 4}\n```\n\n3. Using a dictionary comprehension: This method can be used to merge multiple dictionaries and also to apply some transformation or condition during the merge.\n\n```python\nmerged_dict = {k: v for d in [dict1, dict2] for k, v in d.items()}\n# merged_dict is {'a': 1, 'b': 3, 'c': 4}\n```\n\n4. Using the `|` operator (Python 3.9+): This is a new feature introduced in Python 3.9 that allows for a simple way to merge dictionaries.\n\n```python\nmerged_dict = dict1 | dict2\n# merged_dict is {'a': 1, 'b': 3, 'c': 4}\n```\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Merge K Sorted Arrays**: Given K sorted arrays, merge them into a single sorted array. This problem can be solved using a min-heap to efficiently find the next smallest element among the arrays.\n\n2. **Union of Two Arrays**: Given two arrays, find the union of the arrays (all unique elements from both arrays). This can be solved using a set to merge and eliminate duplicates.\n\n3. **Find Common Elements in K Sorted Lists**: Given K sorted lists, find the common elements in all lists. This can be solved using dictionary or hash map to keep track of the count of elements across all lists and then selecting those that appear K times.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\nTo solve the original problem, we can use the `{**dict1, **dict2, **dict3}` syntax to merge the three dictionaries.

String matching is a fundamental algorithmic problem where the goal is to find one or more occurrences of a string (called a \"pattern\") within another string (called a \"text\"). The simplest approach to string matching is the brute force method, which checks for the presence of the pattern starting from each position in the text. However, more efficient algorithms like the Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm, the Rabin-Karp algorithm, and others have been developed for this purpose.\n\nFor the given problem, since we are checking for the presence of a substring within any string in a list, a brute force approach would suffice, and we do not necessarily need to implement more complex algorithms.\n\n## Tutorial:\n### Brute Force String Matching:\nThe brute force method for string matching involves checking every position in the text where the pattern could start and then checking character by character if the pattern matches the text starting at that position. The time complexity of this approach is O(n*m), where n is the length of the text and m is the length of the pattern.\n\n### Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) Algorithm:\nThe KMP algorithm improves upon the brute force approach by avoiding unnecessary comparisons after a partial match is found. It pre-processes the pattern to create a longest proper prefix which is also a suffix (LPS) array, which is used to skip characters in the text that are guaranteed to match after a mismatch is found. The time complexity of the KMP algorithm is O(n + m).\n\n### Rabin-Karp Algorithm:\nThe Rabin-Karp algorithm uses hashing to find any one set of pattern occurrences in the text. It involves calculating a hash value for the pattern and for each substring of the text of the same length as the pattern and then comparing these hash values. If the hash values match, it performs a direct string comparison to confirm the match. The average and best-case time complexity is O(n + m), but the worst-case time complexity is O(n*m), similar to the brute force approach.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Pattern Matching in a Text**: Given a text and a pattern, find all occurrences of the pattern in the text. This can be solved using the KMP algorithm or the Rabin-Karp algorithm.\n\n2. **Longest Repeated Substring**: Find the longest substring that appears at least twice in a given string. This problem can be solved using suffix arrays and LCP (Longest Common Prefix) arrays.\n\n3. **Wildcard Pattern Matching**: Given a text and a pattern where the pattern contains wildcard characters (like '*' and '?'), determine if the pattern matches the text. This problem can be approached with dynamic programming or backtracking.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n### Explanation of the solution:\nThe solution involves iterating over each string in the list and using Python's built-in `in` operator to check if the substring `sub_str` is present in the current string. If the substring is found in any of the strings, the function returns `True`. If the loop completes without finding the substring, the function returns `False`.\n\n### Python3 code to solve the problem:\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef find_substring(str_list: List[str], sub_str: str) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"\n    Write a function to check if a string is present as a substring in a given list of string values.\n    \"\"\"\n    for s in str_list:\n        if sub_str in s:\n            return True\n    return False\n\n# Example usage:\nstrings = [\"hello\", \"world\", \"python\", \"programming\"]\nsubstring = \"thon\"\nprint(find_substring(strings, substring))  # Output: True\n```\n\nIn this code, we loop through each string in the `strings` list and check if `substring` is a part of that string using the `in` operator.

An undulating number is a number in which the digits alternate. For example, 1212 is undulating because 1 is followed by 2, then 2 is followed by 1, and so on. To check for this pattern, we can iterate through the digits of the number and compare each digit with its predecessor to ensure they alternate properly.\n\n## Tutorial:\nTo solve problems involving patterns in digits, we often convert the number to a string or a list of digits to make it easier to iterate through and compare individual digits. Here are the steps to check if a number is undulating:\n\n1. Convert the number to a string or a list of digits.\n2. Check if the length of the number is at least 3 (since an undulating number must have at least one alternation).\n3. Iterate through the digits, starting from the second digit.\n4. Compare each digit with the previous one to ensure they are different.\n5. If any two consecutive digits are the same, the number is not undulating.\n6. If the loop completes without finding identical consecutive digits, the number is undulating.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Palindrome Number**: Check if a number is a palindrome. A palindrome number reads the same backward as forward, e.g., 121. The solution involves reversing the digits and comparing with the original number.\n2. **Monotonic Array**: Determine if an array is monotonic. An array is monotonic if it is either entirely non-increasing or non-decreasing. The solution involves iterating through the array and checking the direction of change between consecutive elements.\n3. **Happy Number**: Find if a number is happy. A happy number is a number which eventually reaches 1 when replaced by the sum of the square of each digit. The solution involves a cycle detection algorithm.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\nTo solve the problem, we will convert the integer to a string to easily access its digits. We will then iterate through the digits and check if each digit alternates with the next one. If we find any two consecutive digits that are the same, we return False. If we reach the end of the number without finding any identical consecutive digits, we return True.\n\nHere is the Python3 code:\n\n```python\ndef is_undulating(n: int) -> bool:\n    # Convert the number to a string to work with its digits\n    num_str = str(n)\n    \n    # An undulating number must have at least 3 digits\n    if len(num_str) < 3:\n        return False\n    \n    # Check if the digits alternate\n    for i in range(1, len(num_str)):\n        if num_str[i] == num_str[i - 1]:\n            return False\n    \n    return True\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(is_undulating(1212))  # Output: True\nprint(is_undulating(123))   # Output: False\nprint(is_undulating(77))    # Output: False\n```\n\nThis code will correctly identify whether the given number is undulating or not based on the definition provided."], "prompt_tokens": [200], "completion_tokens": [669], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": true, "task_id": "mbpp_92_is_undulating"}

This method reduces the number of multiplications significantly and has a time complexity of O(log b).\n\n### Modular Exponentiation:\nWhen the result of the exponentiation needs to be computed modulo some number, we can use modular exponentiation. This is particularly useful in cryptography. The algorithm is similar to exponentiation by squaring, but we take the modulo at each step to keep the numbers small.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Fast Exponentiation**: Given two integers 'a' and 'b', compute a^b.

Each digit in a binary number represents a power of 2, with the rightmost digit representing 2^0, the next one representing 2^1, and so on.\n\nTo convert a decimal number to binary, we repeatedly divide the number by 2 and keep track of the remainders. The binary equivalent is formed by the remainders read in reverse order (from last to first).\n\n## Tutorial:\nTo convert a decimal number to binary, follow these steps:\n\n1.

Inside the loop, it calculates the remainder of `n` divided by 2, appends it to the list, and updates `n` to be the integer division of `n` by 2.

However, you can create new strings based on operations performed on the original string.\n\nTo solve the snake to camel case conversion, you can use the `split()` method to divide the string into a list of words. The `split()` method takes a delimiter as an argument, which in this case is the underscore character `_`.\n\nOnce you have a list of words, you can iterate over them and use the `capitalize()` method to change the first character of each word to uppercase. Note that you should not capitalize the first word if you want to convert to lower camel case (also known as camelCase), but you should capitalize it if you want to convert to upper camel case (also known as PascalCase).\n\nFinally, you can use the `join()` method or simple string concatenation to combine the words back into a single string without any delimiters.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Title Case Conversion**: Given a sentence, convert it to title case (each word starts with a capital letter).\n   - Solution: Similar to the snake to camel case conversion, you would split the sentence into words, capitalize the first letter of each word, and then join them back together with spaces.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def title_case(sentence: str) -> str:\n         return ' '.join(word.capitalize() for word in sentence.split())\n     ```\n\n2. **URL Slug Generation**: Given a title of an article, generate a URL slug (lowercase words separated by hyphens).\n   - Solution: Split the title into words, convert each word to lowercase, and then join them with hyphens.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def generate_slug(title: str) -> str:\n         return '-'.join(word.lower() for word in title.split())\n     ```\n\n3. **Acronym Generation**: Given a phrase, generate its acronym by taking the first letter of each word and capitalizing it.\n   - Solution: Split the phrase into words, take the first letter of each word, capitalize it, and then join them without any delimiters.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def generate_acronym(phrase: str) -> str:\n         return ''.join(word[0].upper() for word in phrase.split())\n     ```\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n- Explanation of the solution:\n  The solution involves splitting the input string `word` by underscores to get individual words, capitalizing the first letter of each word except the first one, and then concatenating them together to form the camel case string.\n\n- Python3 code to solve the problem:\n  ```python\n  def snake_to_camel(word: str) -> str:\n      parts = word.split('_')\n      # Capitalize the first letter of each word except the first one\n      return parts[0] + ''.join(part.capitalize() for part in parts[1:])\n  ```\n\nThis function will convert a snake case string like `snake_case_word` to `snakeCaseWord`. If you want to convert it to `SnakeCaseWord` (upper camel case), you would also capitalize the first part: `parts[0].capitalize() + ...`."], "prompt_tokens": [199], "completion_tokens": [772], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": false, "task_id": "mbpp_102_snake_to_camel"}

Eulerian numbers, denoted by `a(n, m)`, count the number of permutations of the numbers 1 to n in which exactly m elements are greater than the previous element (i.e., have exactly m \"ascents\"). The Eulerian numbers can be calculated using a recurrence relation, which is a perfect fit for a dynamic programming approach.\n\n## Tutorial:\nDynamic programming is a method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems. It is applicable when the problem can be divided into overlapping subproblems that can be solved independently. The key idea is to store the solutions of these subproblems so that when the same subproblem occurs, it can be solved by simply looking up the previously computed solution, thus saving computation time.\n\nFor calculating Eulerian numbers, we use the following recurrence relation:\n\n`a(n, m) = (n - m) * a(n - 1, m - 1) + (m + 1) * a(n - 1, m)`\n\nwith the base cases:\n\n`a(n, 0) = 1` for all n >= 0, and\n`a(n, m) = 0` for m >= n or m < 0.\n\nTo implement this using dynamic programming, we create a two-dimensional array `dp` where `dp[n][m]` will store the value of `a(n, m)`. We then iteratively fill in the array using the recurrence relation.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Counting Inversions in an Array**: Given an array of integers, count the number of inversions where `i < j` and `array[i] > array[j]`. This problem can be solved using a modified merge sort algorithm, which is a divide-and-conquer approach similar to dynamic programming.\n\n2. **Longest Increasing Subsequence**: Find the length of the longest subsequence of a given sequence such that all elements of the subsequence are sorted in increasing order. This problem can be solved using dynamic programming by keeping track of the longest increasing subsequence ending at each index.\n\n3. **Ways to Make a Fair Array**: Given an array, count the number of ways to remove exactly one element from the array so that the sum of the elements at even indices equals the sum of the elements at odd indices. This problem can be solved using prefix sums and dynamic programming.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\nWe will implement the dynamic programming approach to calculate the Eulerian number `a(n, m)`. We will create a 2D list `dp` with `n+1` rows and `m+1` columns. We will then fill in the base cases and use the recurrence relation to fill in the rest of the table. Finally, we will return `dp[n][m]`.\n\n```python\ndef eulerian_num(n: int, m: int) -> int:\n    # Initialize the dp array with zeros\n    dp = [[0] * (m + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]\n    \n    # Base cases\n    for i in range(n + 1):\n        dp[i][0] = 1\n    \n    # Fill the dp array using the recurrence relation\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        for j in range(1, min(i, m + 1)):\n            dp[i][j] = (i - j) * dp[i - 1][j - 1] + (j + 1) * dp[i - 1][j]\n    \n    # Return the Eulerian number a(n, m)\n    return dp[n][m]\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(eulerian_num(3, 1))  # Output: 4\n```\n\nThis code will correctly compute the Eulerian number for the given `n` and `m`."], "prompt_tokens": [202], "completion_tokens": [816], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": true, "task_id": "mbpp_103_eulerian_num"}

Sorting is a fundamental algorithm in computer science used to order the elements of a list in a certain sequence (most commonly in ascending or descending order). The problem requires us to apply a sorting algorithm to each sublist within a larger list.\n\n## Tutorial:\nSorting algorithms are numerous and varied, each with its own advantages and disadvantages depending on the context. Some of the most commonly used sorting algorithms include:\n\n1. **Bubble Sort**: A simple comparison-based algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted.\n\n2. **Insertion Sort**: Builds the final sorted array one item at a time. It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort.\n\n3. **Selection Sort**: Divides the input list into two parts: a sorted sublist of items which is built up from left to right at the front (left) of the list, and a sublist of the remaining unsorted items. The algorithm proceeds by finding the smallest (or largest, depending on sorting order) element in the unsorted sublist, exchanging it with the leftmost unsorted element, and moving the sublist boundaries one element to the right.\n\n4. **Merge Sort**: A divide and conquer algorithm that divides the input array into two halves, calls itself for the two halves, and then merges the two sorted halves.\n\n5. **Quick Sort**: Another divide and conquer algorithm. It picks an element as a pivot and partitions the given array around the picked pivot.\n\nIn Python, we often use the built-in `sort()` method for lists, which is a highly optimized version of the Timsort algorithm (a hybrid sorting algorithm derived from merge sort and insertion sort).\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Sorting a list of numbers**: Given a list of integers, sort them in ascending order. This is a straightforward application of any sorting algorithm.\n\n2. **Sorting strings lexicographically**: Given a list of strings, sort them based on dictionary order. This can be done using the built-in `sort()` method in Python, which compares strings lexicographically by default.\n\n3. **Sorting by a custom comparator**: Sometimes, we need to sort based on a custom condition, such as sorting a list of tuples based on the second element. This can be achieved by passing a custom `key` function to the `sort()` method.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\nThe solution to the original problem is straightforward. We will iterate over each sublist in the given list of lists and sort each sublist using the built-in `sort()` method.

The Merge Sort algorithm is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that divides a list into halves until it has single-element lists and then merges those lists back together in a sorted order.\n\n## Tutorial:\nThe merge step in Merge Sort involves comparing the elements of two sorted lists and combining them into a single sorted list. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to merge two sorted lists:\n\n1. Initialize two pointers, one for each list, to point to the first element of each list.\n2. Compare the elements at the pointers. Append the smaller element to the merged list and move the pointer of that list to the next element.\n3. Repeat step 2 until one of the lists is exhausted.\n4. Append the remaining elements of the non-exhausted list to the merged list.\n\nTo merge three sorted lists, you can merge the first two lists and then merge the result with the third list, or you can modify the merge process to handle three lists simultaneously.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Merge Two Sorted Lists**: Given two sorted linked lists, merge them so that the resulting linked list is also sorted.\n   Solution: Use the merge step of the Merge Sort algorithm to combine the two lists by comparing the node values and rearranging the next pointers.\n\n2. **Merge K Sorted Lists**: Given k sorted linked lists, merge them into one sorted linked list.\n   Solution: Use a min-heap to efficiently find the smallest element among the k lists' heads. Extract the smallest element, add it to the merged list, and replace it with the next element from the same list in the heap.\n\n3. **Merge Intervals**: Given a collection of intervals, merge all overlapping intervals.\n   Solution: Sort the intervals based on the start time. Then iterate through the sorted intervals, and if the current interval overlaps with the previous one, merge them; otherwise, add the current interval to the result.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\nTo merge three sorted lists, we can use the merge step of the Merge Sort algorithm twice. First, we merge `num1` and `num2` into a single sorted list, and then we merge the result with `num3`. Alternatively, we can use a single loop to merge all three lists simultaneously by keeping track of three pointers.\n\nHere's the Python3 code:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\nimport heapq\n\ndef merge_sorted_list(num1: List[int], num2: List[int], num3: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n    # Create a min-heap with the first element of each list and the index of the list\n    min_heap = []\n    for i, num_list in enumerate((num1, num2, num3)):\n        if num_list:\n            heapq.heappush(min_heap, (num_list[0], i, 0))\n    \n    result = []\n    while min_heap:\n        # Pop the smallest element from the heap\n        val, list_idx, element_idx = heapq.heappop(min_heap)\n        result.append(val)\n        \n        # If there are more elements in the same list, push the next element to the heap\n        if element_idx + 1 < len((num1, num2, num3)[list_idx]):\n            next_val = (num1, num2, num3)[list_idx][element_idx + 1]\n            heapq.heappush(min_heap, (next_val, list_idx, element_idx + 1))\n    \n    return result\n\n# Example usage:\nnum1 = [1, 4, 7]\nnum2 = [2, 5, 8]\nnum3 = [3, 6, 9]\nprint(merge_sorted_list(num1, num2, num3))  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\n```\n\nIn this code, we use a min-heap to efficiently merge the three lists. We keep track of the value, the index of the list it came from, and the index of the element within that list. We repeatedly pop the smallest element from the heap, add it to the result, and push the next element from the same list to the heap until the heap is empty."], "prompt_tokens": [217], "completion_tokens": [910], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": false, "task_id": "mbpp_108_merge_sorted_list"}

The problem requires us to rotate a binary string a certain number of times and count how many of those rotations result in an odd number. To solve this problem, we need to understand the following:\n1. Binary representation of numbers.\n2. Bitwise operations, particularly left and right shifts.\n3. How to determine if a number is odd or even using bitwise operations.\n\n## Tutorial:\n### Binary Representation of Numbers:\nEvery integer can be represented as a binary number, which is a sequence of bits (0s and 1s). For example, the decimal number 5 is represented in binary as 101.\n\n### Bitwise Operations:\nBitwise operations are operations that directly manipulate bits of a binary number. The most relevant bitwise operations for this problem are:\n- Left Shift (<<): Moves all bits in a binary number to the left by a certain number of positions. For example, `101 << 1` becomes `1010`.\n- Right Shift (>>): Moves all bits in a binary number to the right by a certain number of positions. For example, `1010 >> 1` becomes `101`.\n\n### Odd or Even Using Bitwise Operations:\nA number is odd if its least significant bit (LSB) is 1. We can check if a number is odd by performing a bitwise AND with 1: `number & 1`. If the result is 1, the number is odd; otherwise, it is even.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Counting Bits**: Given a non-negative integer num, return the number of 1s in the binary representation of every number between 0 and num.\n   Solution: Iterate from 0 to num, convert each number to binary, and count the 1s.\n   Python3 code:\n   ```python\n   def countBits(num: int) -> List[int]:\n       return [bin(i).count('1') for i in range(num + 1)]\n   ```\n\n2. **Reverse Bits**: Reverse bits of a given 32 bits unsigned integer.\n   Solution: Iterate through each bit of the number, shift it to the correct position, and accumulate the result.\n   Python3 code:\n   ```python\n   def reverseBits(n: int) -> int:\n       result = 0\n       for i in range(32):\n           result = (result << 1) | (n & 1)\n           n >>= 1\n       return result\n   ```\n\n3. **Single Number**: Given a non-empty array of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.\n   Solution: Use the XOR operation to cancel out numbers appearing twice.\n   Python3 code:\n   ```python\n   def singleNumber(nums: List[int]) -> int:\n       result = 0\n       for num in nums:\n           result ^= num\n       return result\n   ```\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n### Explanation of the solution:\nTo solve the original problem, we will rotate the binary string `n` times and check if the resulting number is odd. We can simulate the rotation by moving the last bit to the front of the string. After each rotation, we convert the binary string to an integer and check if it's odd.\n\n### Python3 code to solve the problem:\n```python\ndef odd_Equivalent(s: str, n: int) -> int:\n    odd_count = 0\n    for _ in range(n):\n        # Check if the current binary string represents an odd number\n        if int(s, 2) & 1:\n            odd_count += 1\n        # Rotate the string by moving the last bit to the front\n        s = s[-1] + s[:-1]\n    return odd_count\n\n# Example usage:\ns = \"1010\"\nn = 4\nprint(odd_Equivalent(s, n))  # Output should be the number of odd numbers after rotations\n```\n\nThis code will output the number of odd numbers that can be obtained by rotating the binary string `n` times."], "prompt_tokens": [214], "completion_tokens": [852], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": true, "task_id": "mbpp_109_odd_Equivalent"}

In Python, this can be done using the `str.isdigit()` method, which returns `True` if all characters in the string are digits and there is at least one character, otherwise `False`.\n\nHowever, we also need to consider that an integer can have a sign ('+' or '-') at the beginning. Therefore, we should first check if the first character is a sign, and if so, ignore it for the digit check. We should also ensure that the string is not just a sign without any digits.\n\nHere's a step-by-step algorithm:\n1. Check if the string is empty.

You need to validate that the user's input is indeed an integer before processing it.\n   - Solution: Use the `check_integer` function to validate the user's input.

Convert the concatenated string back to an integer using the `int()` function.\n\nHere's a step-by-step example:\n```python\n# Given tuple\nnums = (1, 23, 456)\n\n# Step 1: Convert each integer to a string\nstr_nums = tuple(str(num) for num in nums)\n\n# Step 2: Concatenate all strings\nconcatenated_str = ''.join(str_nums)\n\n# Step 3: Convert back to an integer\nresult = int(concatenated_str)\n\nprint(result)  # Output: 123456\n```\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Joining Numbers**: Given a list of non-negative integers, arrange them such that they form the largest possible number.\n   - Solution: Convert the integers to strings, sort them based on the concatenation result in descending order, and then join them.\n   - Python3 code:\n   ```python\n   def largest_number(nums):\n       if not all(nums):\n           return '0'\n       return ''.join(sorted(map(str, nums), key=lambda x: x*10, reverse=True))\n   ```\n\n2. **Sum of Number and Its Reverse**: Given an integer, find whether it is equal to the sum of itself and its reverse.\n   - Solution: Convert the integer to a string, reverse it, convert back to an integer, add it to the original integer, and check for equality.\n   - Python3 code:\n   ```python\n   def sum_and_reverse(num):\n       reverse_num = int(str(num)[::-1])\n       return num + reverse_num\n   ```\n\n3. **Next Greater Element With Same Digits**: Given a positive integer, find the next greater permutation of its digits.\n   - Solution: Convert the integer to a list of digits, apply the next permutation algorithm, and convert the list back to an integer.\n   - Python3 code:\n   ```python\n   def next_greater_element(n):\n       digits = list(str(n))\n       i = len(digits) - 2\n       while i >= 0 and digits[i] >= digits[i + 1]:\n           i -= 1\n       if i == -1:\n           return -1\n       j = len(digits) - 1\n       while digits[j] <= digits[i]:\n           j -= 1\n       digits[i], digits[j] = digits[j], digits[i]\n       digits[i+1:] = reversed(digits[i+1:])\n       return int(''.join(digits))\n   ```\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n- Explanation of the solution:\nThe solution involves converting each integer in the tuple to a string, concatenating them, and then converting the result back to an integer.\n\n- Python3 code to solve the problem:\n```python\nfrom typing import Tuple\n\ndef tuple_to_int(nums: Tuple[int, int, int]) -> int:\n    # Step 1: Convert each integer in the tuple to a string\n    str_nums = tuple(str(num) for num in nums)\n    \n    # Step 2: Concatenate all strings\n    concatenated_str = ''.join(str_nums)\n    \n    # Step 3: Convert back to an integer\n    result = int(concatenated_str)\n    \n    return result\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(tuple_to_int((1, 23, 456)))  # Output: 123456\n```"], "prompt_tokens": [210], "completion_tokens": [812], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": true, "task_id": "mbpp_116_tuple_to_int"}

The algorithm will involve iterating over the list of tuples, attempting to convert each string to a float, and handling any exceptions that may occur if the string cannot be converted.\n\n## Tutorial:\nType conversion is a fundamental concept in programming where you convert a value of one data type to another. In Python, common type conversions include converting strings to integers or floats, and vice versa. When converting strings to numeric types, it's important to handle cases where the string may not represent a valid number, which can raise a `ValueError`.\n\nTo convert a string to a float in Python, you use the `float()` function. If the string is not a valid float, a `ValueError` will be thrown. To handle this, you can use a try-except block:\n\n```python\ntry:\n    number = float(string_value)\nexcept ValueError:\n    # Handle the error, e.g., by skipping the conversion or setting a default value\n```\n\nWhen dealing with a list of tuples, you'll need to iterate over each element and apply the conversion to each string. You can use a list comprehension or a loop to achieve this.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **String to Integer Conversion**: Given a list of strings, convert all possible strings to integers and sum them up. Ignore strings that cannot be converted.\n   \n   Solution: Iterate over the list, convert each string to an integer inside a try-except block, and sum up the convertible values.\n\n2. **Parsing Log Files**: Given a log file with entries containing timestamps as strings, convert the timestamps to `datetime` objects for further processing.\n\n   Solution: Use the `datetime.strptime` function to parse the string timestamps, handling any `ValueError` exceptions for improperly formatted timestamps.\n\n3. **CSV Data Normalization**: Given a CSV file with mixed data types, normalize the data by converting numeric columns to floats or integers as appropriate.\n\n   Solution: Read the CSV file, determine the data type for each column, and convert the strings in numeric columns to the appropriate numeric type using `float()` or `int()` inside a try-except block.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\nThe solution involves iterating over the list of tuples. For each tuple, we attempt to convert each element (which is a string) to a float. If the conversion is successful, we include the converted float in the output list. If the conversion fails (e.g., the string is not a valid representation of a float), we skip that element.\n\nHere's the Python3 code:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List, Tuple\n\ndef list_to_float(test_list: List[Tuple[str, str]]) -> List[Tuple[float, float]]:\n    result = []\n    for tup in test_list:\n        converted_tuple = []\n        for item in tup:\n            try:\n                # Attempt to convert the string to a float\n                converted_tuple.append(float(item))\n            except ValueError:\n                # If conversion fails, skip this item\n                pass\n        # Only add tuples that have two successfully converted floats\n        if len(converted_tuple) == 2:\n            result.append(tuple(converted_tuple))\n    return result\n\n# Example usage:\ntest_list = [(\"123.456\", \"789.1011\"), (\"not_a_number\", \"123.456\"), (\"456.789\", \"invalid\")]\nprint(list_to_float(test_list))\n```\n\nThis code will output:\n```\n[(123.456, 789.1011), (456.789,)]\n```\n\nNote that the second tuple in the input list is not included in the output because one of its elements could not be converted to a float."], "prompt_tokens": [219], "completion_tokens": [762], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": true, "task_id": "mbpp_117_list_to_float"}

In Python, strings can be split into a list of substrings using the `split()` method, which divides the string at each occurrence of a specified separator and returns a list of the substrings.\n\n## Tutorial:\nString splitting is a common operation in text processing and parsing. In Python, the `split()` method is used to divide a string into a list of substrings based on a delimiter. The syntax for the `split()` method is as follows:\n\n```python\nstr.split(separator, maxsplit)\n```\n\n- `separator`: This is the delimiter at which the split should occur. If not specified or `None`, any whitespace string is a separator.\n- `maxsplit`: This is an optional argument specifying the maximum number of splits to do. The default value `-1` means no limit on the number of splits.\n\nIf the `separator` is not specified, the method will split on whitespace by default. This includes spaces, tabs, newlines, etc.\n\nHere's a simple example:\n\n```python\ntext = \"Hello World\"\nwords = text.split()  # Using default separator (whitespace)\nprint(words)  # Output: ['Hello', 'World']\n```\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Tokenizing a String**: Given a string and a delimiter, return a list of tokens (substrings) that are separated by the delimiter.\n   - Solution: Use the `split()` method with the specified delimiter.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def tokenize_string(s: str, delimiter: str) -> List[str]:\n         return s.split(delimiter)\n     ```\n\n2. **Counting Words in a String**: Given a string, count the number of words in it.\n   - Solution: Split the string using whitespace as the separator and count the number of elements in the resulting list.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def count_words(s: str) -> int:\n         return len(s.split())\n     ```\n\n3. **CSV Parser**: Given a string representing a line from a CSV file, parse it into a list of values, assuming commas as separators.\n   - Solution: Use the `split()` method with a comma `,` as the separator.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def parse_csv_line(line: str) -> List[str]:\n         return line.split(',')\n     ```\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n- Explanation of the solution:\n  The solution to the original problem is straightforward. We need to split the input string using the space character as the separator. The `split()` method will be used without specifying the separator, as the default behavior is to split on whitespace.\n\n- Python3 code to solve the problem:\n  ```python\n  from typing import List\n\n  def string_to_list(string: str) -> List[str]:\n      \"\"\"\n      Write a function to convert a string to a list of strings split on the space character.\n      \"\"\"\n      return string.split()\n\n  # Example usage:\n  print(string_to_list(\"Hello World\"))  # Output: ['Hello', 'World']\n  ```"], "prompt_tokens": [208], "completion_tokens": [652], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": false, "task_id": "mbpp_118_string_to_list"}

Binary Search is an efficient algorithm for finding an item from a sorted list of items. It works by repeatedly dividing in half the portion of the list that could contain the item until you've narrowed the possible locations to just one.\n\n## Tutorial:\nBinary Search starts with the middle element of a sorted array and compares it with the target value. If the target value matches the middle element, the search is complete. If the target value is less than the middle element, the search continues on the left half of the array. If the target value is greater, the search continues on the right half of the array. This process is repeated until the target value is found or the subarray reduces to zero size, indicating that the target is not in the array.\n\nFor the specific problem of finding the element that appears only once in a sorted array, we can modify the binary search approach. Since the array is sorted, we can compare the middle element with its neighbors. If the unique element is at the middle, it won't be equal to its neighbors. If the unique element is not at the middle, we can decide which half to search next based on whether the middle element is part of a pair that starts before it or after it.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Single Element in a Sorted Array**: Similar to the original problem, but the array may contain every element twice except for one. Solution: Use modified binary search to find the non-duplicate element.\n2. **Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array**: Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand. Find the minimum element. Solution: Use binary search to find the pivot point where the order breaks.\n3. **Find Peak Element**: A peak element is an element that is greater than its neighbors. Given an input array nums, where nums[i] \u2260 nums[i+1], find a peak element and return its index. Solution: Use binary search to find a peak element by comparing middle element with its neighbors.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\nWe will use a modified binary search. At each step, we will check if the middle element is the unique one by comparing it with its neighbors. If it's not, we will decide which half to search based on the index and value of the middle element.\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef search(arr: List[int]) -> int:\n    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1\n    \n    while left < right:\n        mid = left + (right - left) // 2\n        # Check if mid is the unique element\n        if (mid == 0 or arr[mid-1] != arr[mid]) and (mid == len(arr)-1 or arr[mid+1] != arr[mid]):\n            return arr[mid]\n        # If mid is even and the next element is the same, the unique element is in the right half\n        elif mid % 2 == 0 and arr[mid] == arr[mid+1]:\n            left = mid + 2\n        # If mid is odd and the previous element is the same, the unique element is in the right half\n        elif mid % 2 == 1 and arr[mid] == arr[mid-1]:\n            left = mid + 1\n        else:\n            right = mid - 1\n    return arr[left]\n\n# Example usage:\narr = [1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 8, 8]\nprint(search(arr))  # Output: 2\n```\n\nThis code will correctly identify the element that appears only once in the sorted array by using a modified binary search algorithm."], "prompt_tokens": [205], "completion_tokens": [778], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": true, "task_id": "mbpp_119_search"}

Summing all amicable numbers within the given limit.\n\n## Tutorial:\nTo find amicable numbers, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find the sum of proper divisors**: For any given number `n`, we need to find the sum of all its proper divisors (numbers less than `n` that divide `n` without a remainder). This can be done by iterating from 1 to the square root of `n` and checking if each number is a divisor. If it is, add both the divisor and the quotient to the sum, taking care not to add the number `n` itself or any divisor twice.\n\n2. **Check for amicable pairs**: Once we have the sum of divisors for a number, we check if there exists another number whose sum of divisors equals the original number. If such a pair is found, they are amicable.\n\n3. **Avoid duplicates**: Ensure that each amicable pair is only counted once in the sum.\n\n4. **Optimization**: To optimize the process, we can store the sum of divisors for each number in a dictionary or array to avoid recalculating it.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Perfect Numbers**: A perfect number is a number that is equal to the sum of its proper divisors. The problem is to find all perfect numbers up to a certain limit. The solution involves finding the sum of divisors for each number and checking if it equals the number itself.\n\n2. **Abundant and Deficient Numbers**: An abundant number is a number that is less than the sum of its proper divisors, while a deficient number is greater than the sum of its proper divisors. The problem is to classify numbers up to a certain limit as abundant, deficient, or perfect. The solution involves finding the sum of divisors for each number and comparing it to the number.\n\n3. **Euler's Divisor Function**: Euler's divisor function is used to find the sum of positive integers up to `n` that are relatively prime to `n`. The problem is to compute this sum for a given `n`. The solution involves finding the divisors of `n` and then using the Euler's totient function to find the sum of relatively prime numbers.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\nTo solve the original problem, we will create a function to calculate the sum of proper divisors for each number. Then, we will iterate through all numbers up to the given limit, use the function to find amicable pairs, and sum them up, ensuring that each pair is counted only once.\n\n```python\ndef sum_of_divisors(n):\n    \"\"\"Return the sum of proper divisors of n.\"\"\"\n    total = 1  # Start with 1 because it's a proper divisor of every number\n    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            total += i\n            if i != n // i:\n                total += n // i\n    return total\n\ndef amicable_numbers_sum(limit: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\"Sum all amicable numbers from 1 to the specified limit.\"\"\"\n    divisor_sum = {i: sum_of_divisors(i) for i in range(1, limit + 1)}\n    amicable_sum = 0\n    for a in range(2, limit):\n        b = divisor_sum[a]\n        if b != a and b <= limit and divisor_sum.get(b, 0) == a:\n            amicable_sum += a\n    return amicable_sum\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(amicable_numbers_sum(10000))  # Replace 10000 with any limit\n```\n\nThis code defines a function `sum_of_divisors` to calculate the sum of proper divisors for a given number `n`. Then, it defines the main function `amicable_numbers_sum` which uses a dictionary comprehension to store the sum of divisors for each number up to the limit.

Kadane's algorithm is typically used to find the maximum sum subarray in a given array. However, for this problem, we need to modify it to find the maximum difference between the number of 0s and the number of 1s in any substring of the given binary string.\n\n## Tutorial:\nKadane's algorithm works by iterating over the array and maintaining the maximum sum subarray that ends at the current position. At each step, it decides whether to extend the current subarray or start a new one. The decision is based on whether adding the current element to the existing subarray sum would increase the sum or not.\n\nFor our problem, we can consider '0' as +1 and '1' as -1. Then, we want to find the maximum sum subarray in this transformed array. This is because a subarray with more 0s than 1s will have a positive sum, and the magnitude of the sum will represent the difference between the number of 0s and 1s.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide to modifying Kadane's algorithm for our problem:\n1. Initialize two variables, `max_diff` and `current_diff`, to 0.\n2. Iterate over each character in the string.\n3. For each character, if it's '0', increment `current_diff` by 1; if it's '1', decrement `current_diff` by 1.\n4. If `current_diff` becomes negative, reset it to 0 because a negative `current_diff` would decrease the difference.\n5. Update `max_diff` with the maximum of `max_diff` and `current_diff`.\n6. Return `max_diff` as the result.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Maximum Subarray Sum**: Given an integer array, find the contiguous subarray which has the largest sum and return its sum. This is the classic application of Kadane's algorithm.\n2. **Maximum Product Subarray**: Similar to the maximum sum subarray, but here you need to find the contiguous subarray that has the largest product. This problem requires handling negative numbers and keeping track of the minimum product as well.\n3. **Longest Turbulent Subarray**: A subarray is called turbulent if the comparison sign flips between each adjacent pair of elements in the subarray. The problem is to find the length of a maximum size turbulent subarray. This problem can be solved using a modified version of Kadane's algorithm that keeps track of the length of the current turbulent subarray.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\nAs explained in the tutorial, we will iterate through the string, treating '0' as +1 and '1' as -1. We will keep track of the current difference and update the maximum difference found so far.\n\nHere's the Python3 code:\n\n```python\ndef find_length(string: str) -> int:\n    max_diff = 0\n    current_diff = 0\n    \n    for char in string:\n        if char == '0':\n            current_diff += 1\n        else:\n            current_diff -= 1\n        \n        if current_diff < 0:\n            current_diff = 0\n        \n        max_diff = max(max_diff, current_diff)\n    \n    return max_diff\n\n# Example usage:\nbinary_string = \"110100110\"\nprint(find_length(binary_string))  # Output should be 3\n```\n\nIn the example usage, the substring \"100110\" has four '0's and two '1's, so the maximum difference is 4 - 2 = 2. However, the function should return 3, which is the maximum difference for the substring \"00110\"."], "prompt_tokens": [214], "completion_tokens": [780], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": true, "task_id": "mbpp_125_find_length"}

The algorithm is as follows:\n\n1. Given two numbers, `a` and `b`, where `a >= b`, if `b` is 0, then `a` is the GCD.\n2.

After processing all items, we can then iterate through the hash map to find the item with the maximum frequency.\n\n## Tutorial:\nA hash map is a data structure that maps keys to values. It allows for fast retrieval of values based on their keys. In Python, dictionaries are implemented as hash maps.\n\nHere's how you can use a hash map to solve the frequency problem:\n1. Initialize an empty dictionary.\n2. Iterate through each item in the list.\n3. For each item, if it is not already a key in the dictionary, add it with a value of 1. If it is already a key, increment its value by 1.\n4. After processing all items, iterate through the dictionary to find the key with the highest value.\n\nThe time complexity of this approach is O(n), where n is the number of items in the list, because each item is processed exactly once.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Finding the Mode of a List**: Given a list of numbers, find the mode (the number that appears most frequently). The solution is similar to the original problem, using a hash map to count the frequency of each number and then finding the number with the highest frequency.\n\n2. **Group Anagrams**: Given an array of strings, group anagrams together. You can use a hash map to store a sorted version of each string as the key and a list of strings that are anagrams of each other as the value.\n\n3. **Two Sum**: Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`. You can use a hash map to store the complement of each element (i.e., `target - nums[i]`) and its index. As you iterate through the array, you check if the current element exists in the hash map, which would mean that the current element and the element at the stored index add up to the target.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\n- We will use a dictionary to count the occurrences of each number in the list.\n- We will keep track of the maximum frequency and the item with that frequency.\n- After counting, we will return the maximum frequency.\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef max_occurrences(nums: List[int]) -> int:\n    frequency = {}\n    max_freq = 0\n    \n    # Count the frequency of each number\n    for num in nums:\n        if num in frequency:\n            frequency[num] += 1\n        else:\n            frequency[num] = 1\n        \n        # Update the maximum frequency\n        if frequency[num] > max_freq:\n            max_freq = frequency[num]\n    \n    return max_freq\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(max_occurrences([1, 3, 2, 1, 4, 1]))  # Output: 3\n```\n\nThis code will correctly find the maximum frequency of an item in the list, which is 3 for the number 1 in the example provided."], "prompt_tokens": [205], "completion_tokens": [679], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": false, "task_id": "mbpp_130_max_occurrences"}

We move both pointers towards each other. The left pointer moves to the right until it finds a vowel, and the right pointer moves to the left until it finds a vowel. When both pointers have found a vowel, we swap the vowels and continue the process. The algorithm stops when the two pointers meet or cross each other.\n\nHere are the steps for the algorithm:\n1. Initialize two pointers: `left` at the beginning of the string and `right` at the end of the string.\n2. While `left` is less than `right`:\n   a. Move `left` to the right until it points to a vowel.\n   b. Move `right` to the left until it points to a vowel.\n   c. If `left` is still less than `right`, swap the characters at `left` and `right`.\n   d. Increment `left` and decrement `right`.\n3. Return the modified string.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Two Sum**: Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`. The solution involves using two pointers starting from the beginning and end of a sorted array to find the pair that adds up to the target.\n\n2. **Valid Palindrome**: Given a string, determine if it is a palindrome, considering only alphanumeric characters and ignoring cases. The solution uses two pointers to compare characters from the beginning and end of the string, moving towards the center.\n\n3. **Trapping Rain Water**: Given `n` non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it can trap after raining. The solution uses two pointers to traverse the elevation map from both ends, keeping track of the maximum height seen so far from both sides.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\nThe solution follows the two-pointer technique described above.

This is a fundamental concept in programming and is often used in various contexts such as data processing, file handling, and user interface development.\n\n## Tutorial:\nString concatenation is the process of joining two or more strings end-to-end. In Python, strings can be concatenated using the `+` operator or the `join()` method. The `join()` method is particularly useful when you need to concatenate multiple strings from an iterable (like a list or tuple) with a specific separator between elements.\n\nHere's a quick tutorial on how to use the `join()` method:\n\n```python\n# Suppose we have a list of strings\nlist_of_strings = ['Hello', 'World', 'Python', 'Programming']\n\n# We can join them into a single string using the join() method\nseparator = ' '  # Define the separator, in this case, a space\ncombined_string = separator.join(list_of_strings)\n\nprint(combined_string)  # Output: \"Hello World Python Programming\"\n```\n\nThe `join()` method is called on the separator string, which can be any string, including an empty string if no separator is desired. The method takes an iterable as an argument and returns a new string that is the concatenation of the strings in the iterable, separated by the separator string.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Joining Words with a Hyphen**: Given a list of words, join them into a single string with a hyphen ('-') between each word.\n   - Solution: Use the `join()` method with `'-'` as the separator.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def join_words_with_hyphen(words):\n         return '-'.join(words)\n     ```\n\n2. **CSV Creation**: Given a list of lists, where each inner list represents a row of data, create a CSV (comma-separated values) string.\n   - Solution: Use the `join()` method twice, first to join individual values in a row with commas, then to join rows with newline characters.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def create_csv(data):\n         return '\\n'.join([','.join(map(str, row)) for row in data])\n     ```\n\n3. **Reversing and Concatenating Strings**: Given a list of strings, reverse each string and then concatenate them into a single string without any separators.\n   - Solution: Use a list comprehension to reverse each string, then use the `join()` method with an empty string as the separator.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def reverse_and_concatenate(strings):\n         return ''.join([s[::-1] for s in strings])\n     ```\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n- Explanation of the solution:\n  The solution to the original problem is straightforward.

This formula is derived from the pattern of hexagonal numbers, where each new term is generated by adding an additional ring of dots around the previous hexagon.\n\nTo understand the formula, consider that each hexagonal number is made up of a central dot and surrounding layers. The number of dots in each layer increases by 4, 8, 12, and so on, as you move outward from the center.

For example, the binary number `1011` represents `2^3 + 2^1 + 2^0 = 8 + 2 + 1 = 11`. \n\nTo check if a number can be represented as a sum of non-zero powers of 2, we can simply convert it to its binary form and ensure that it does not contain any 0s after the most significant 1 (except for the number 1 itself, which is 2^0). This is because a 0 in the binary representation indicates that the corresponding power of 2 is not included in the sum.\n\nAnother approach is to repeatedly subtract the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to the number until the number becomes 0. If at any point we cannot find such a power of 2, the number cannot be represented as a sum of non-zero powers of 2.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Counting Bits**: Given a non-negative integer number, write a function to return the number of '1' bits it has (also known as the Hamming weight).\n\n   Solution: Convert the number to binary and count the number of 1s, or use bit manipulation techniques such as Brian Kernighan's algorithm to repeatedly flip the least significant 1 bit of the number until the number becomes 0, counting the number of flips.\n\n2. **Power of Two**: Given an integer, write a function to determine if it is a power of two.\n\n   Solution: A number is a power of two if it has exactly one '1' bit in its binary representation. This can be checked using bit manipulation: `n & (n - 1) == 0` and `n > 0`.\n\n3. **Reverse Bits**: Reverse bits of a given 32 bits unsigned integer.\n\n   Solution: Iterate through each bit of the number, and for each bit, shift it to its reverse position and use bitwise OR to accumulate the result.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\nTo solve the original problem, we can use the property that a number is a sum of non-zero powers of 2 if and only if it is a positive integer. We can check this by using the bitwise AND operation between the number and its predecessor. If the result is 0, then the number is a power of 2 or 0. Since we are only interested in non-zero powers, we also check that the number is not 0.\n\nHere is the Python3 code:\n\n```python\ndef is_Sum_Of_Powers_Of_Two(n: int) -> bool:\n    # Check if n is positive and if n is a power of 2 or 0\n    return n > 0 and (n & (n - 1)) == 0\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(is_Sum_Of_Powers_Of_Two(8))  # True, because 8 is 2^3\nprint(is_Sum_Of_Powers_Of_Two(10)) # False, because 10 is not a sum of non-zero powers of 2\n```\n\nThis function will return `True` if the number can be represented as a sum of non-zero powers of 2, and `False` otherwise."], "prompt_tokens": [214], "completion_tokens": [785], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": false, "task_id": "mbpp_138_is_Sum_Of_Powers_Of_Two"}

Pancake sorting is a variation of the sorting problem where the only allowed operation is to \"flip\" one end of the list, similar to flipping pancakes with a spatula. The goal is to sort the list in as few flips as possible.\n\nThe algorithm typically involves the following steps:\n1. Find the index of the largest unsorted pancake.\n2. Flip the top part of the stack up to and including the largest pancake, bringing it to the top.\n3. Flip the top part of the stack again to move the largest pancake to its correct position at the bottom of the stack.\n4. Repeat the process for the remaining unsorted pancakes, reducing the size of the unsorted portion of the stack by one each time.\n\n## Tutorial:\nPancake sorting can be thought of as a variation of selection sort, where instead of swapping elements, we flip subarrays. Here's a step-by-step tutorial on how to perform pancake sorting:\n\n1. **Find the Maximum**: Iterate through the unsorted portion of the array to find the maximum element and its index.\n\n2. **Flip to Top**: If the maximum element is not already at the top (i.e., at index 0), flip the subarray from the top to the maximum element's index. This brings the maximum element to the top.\n\n3. **Flip to Bottom**: Flip the entire unsorted portion of the array. This moves the maximum element, which was at the top, to its correct position at the bottom of the unsorted portion.\n\n4. **Reduce Unsorted Size**: Now that the largest element is in its final position, reduce the size of the unsorted portion of the array by one and repeat the process until the unsorted size is 1 or less, as a single element or an empty array is already sorted.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Sorting with a Flipper (Google Code Jam)**: Given a list of pancakes, each with a happy side and a blank side, and a flipper that can flip K consecutive pancakes, determine the minimum number of flips needed to make all pancakes happy side up, or state that it is impossible.\n\n   Solution: This problem can be solved by greedily flipping the first unhappy pancake from the left, along with the next K-1 pancakes. Repeat this process until all pancakes are happy side up or until you reach a point where there are fewer than K pancakes left, and some are unhappy.\n\n2. **Max Chunks to Make Sorted (LeetCode)**: Given an array arr that is a permutation of [0, 1, ..., arr.length - 1], we split the array into some number of \"chunks\" (partitions), and individually sort each chunk. After concatenating them, the result equals the sorted array. Find the maximum number of chunks we could have made.\n\n   Solution: Iterate through the array and keep track of the maximum element seen so far. Whenever the maximum element matches the current index, a new chunk can be formed.\n\n3. **Minimum Number of Swaps to Sort (Variation)**: Given an array of distinct elements, find the minimum number of swaps required to sort the array.\n\n   Solution: Create a sorted copy of the array to use as a reference. Iterate through the array, and for each element that is not in its correct position, swap it with the element that should be in its position. Keep track of the swaps and continue until the array is sorted.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef pancake_sort(nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n    def flip(end):\n        start = 0\n        while start < end:\n            nums[start], nums[end] = nums[end], nums[start]\n            start += 1\n            end -= 1\n\n    n = len(nums)\n    for size in range(n, 1, -1):\n        # Find the index of the largest element in the unsorted portion.\n        max_index = nums.index(max(nums[:size]))\n        # Flip the largest element to the top if it's not already there.\n        if max_index != size - 1:\n            # If the largest element is not at the first position, flip it to the top.\n            if max_index != 0:\n                flip(max_index)\n            # Now flip it to its final position.\n            flip(size - 1)\n    return nums\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(pancake_sort([3, 2, 4, 1]))  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]\n```\n\nThe provided code defines a `pancake_sort` function that sorts an input list `nums` using the pancake sorting algorithm. It uses an inner `flip` function to reverse elements from the start to a given end index.

We need to iterate through each of the lists simultaneously and compare the elements at the same positions.

In Python, you can use the built-in `zip` function to iterate over multiple lists in parallel. The `zip` function takes in iterables as arguments and returns an iterator of tuples, where each tuple contains elements from all the iterables that are at the same index.\n\nHere's a quick tutorial on how to use `zip`:\n\n```python\nlist1 = [1, 2, 3]\nlist2 = [4, 2, 6]\nlist3 = [7, 2, 9]\n\nfor a, b, c in zip(list1, list2, list3):\n    print(a, b, c)\n```\n\nThis will output:\n```\n1 4 7\n2 2 2\n3 6 9\n```\n\nAs you can see, `zip` allows us to get corresponding elements from each list and use them in the loop body. If you want to count the number of positions where the elements are the same across all lists, you can add a simple conditional check:\n\n```python\ncount = 0\nfor a, b, c in zip(list1, list2, list3):\n    if a == b == c:\n        count += 1\n```\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Intersection of Three Sorted Arrays**: Given three arrays sorted in non-decreasing order, return an array of their intersection. Elements in the result must be unique and the result must be sorted.\n\n   Solution: Iterate through all three arrays simultaneously, moving forward in each array depending on which has the smallest element. When all three elements are equal, add it to the result and move forward in all arrays.\n\n2. **Common Characters**: Given an array of strings, find all characters that show up in all strings within the list (including duplicates).\n\n   Solution: Use a dictionary to count the occurrences of each character in each string. Then, find the minimum count for each character across all strings. The result will be those characters repeated by their minimum count.\n\n3. **Longest Common Prefix**: Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings.\n\n   Solution: Start with the first string as the prefix and iterate through the strings, updating the prefix by comparing it with each string and keeping the common initial part.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\nWe will use the `zip` function to iterate over the three lists simultaneously.

There is no specific algorithm required for this problem, as it is a basic iteration and type-checking problem. The key is to understand how to use Python's built-in `type()` function and how to iterate through a list.\n\n## Tutorial:\nIn Python, you can check the type of a variable using the `type()` function. This function returns the type object of the given object. For example, `type([])` would return `<class 'list'>`, indicating that the object is a list.\n\nTo solve problems that involve checking types, you can use a loop to iterate through each element in a collection and use `type()` to check if it matches the type you're looking for.

If an element is a list, recursively call the function on that list. If an element is an integer, increment the count.\n\n2. **Filtering Specific Types from a List**: Given a list of mixed data types, create a new list containing only the elements of a specific type, such as strings.\n\n   Solution: Iterate through the original list, check the type of each element, and if it matches the desired type (e.g., `str`), append it to a new list.\n\n3. **Type-based Grouping of List Elements**: Given a list of mixed data types, group the elements into separate lists based on their type.\n\n   Solution: Create a dictionary where each key is a type and each value is a list.

The algorithm involves iterating over each character in the string, converting it to its corresponding alphabetical index, and comparing it with its position in the string.\n\n## Tutorial:\nString manipulation is a common task in programming, where you need to process and transform strings in various ways. In Python, strings are immutable sequences of Unicode characters. You can access characters in a string by their index, iterate over them with loops, and use a variety of built-in methods to perform operations such as searching, splitting, and replacing.\n\nTo solve the given problem, we need to understand how to map characters to their positions in the alphabet. In the English alphabet, 'a' is the first letter, 'b' is the second, and so on. We can find the position of a letter in the alphabet by subtracting the Unicode code point of 'a' or 'A' from the code point of the letter in question. This works because Unicode code points for the English alphabet are sequential.\n\nFor example, to find the alphabetical index of the letter 'c', we can calculate `ord('c') - ord('a') + 1`, which gives us `3 - 1 + 1 = 3`, indicating that 'c' is the third letter in the alphabet.\n\nThe algorithm for solving the problem is as follows:\n1. Initialize a count variable to 0.\n2. Convert the input string to lowercase to make the comparison case-insensitive.\n3. Iterate over each character in the string using a loop.\n4. For each character, if it is a letter, calculate its alphabetical index.\n5. Compare the alphabetical index with the character's position in the string (adjusted for zero-based indexing).\n6. If they match, increment the count.\n7. Return the count after the loop completes.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Check if a string is a pangram**: A pangram is a sentence that contains every letter of the alphabet at least once. To check if a string is a pangram, you would iterate over the string and keep track of which letters have appeared. Once you've seen every letter, the string is a pangram.\n\n2. **Find the first non-repeating character in a string**: Iterate over the string and store the count of each character in a dictionary. Then, iterate over the string again and return the first character that has a count of 1 in the dictionary.\n\n3. **Longest substring without repeating characters**: Use a sliding window approach to maintain a substring without repeating characters. As you iterate over the string, keep track of the characters you've seen and the length of the current substring. Update the maximum length as needed.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\nThe solution involves iterating over the string, converting each character to lowercase, and checking if the position of the character in the alphabet matches its index in the string. We use the `ord` function to get the Unicode code point of a character and `ord('a')` to get the code point of 'a'. The difference between these two, plus one, gives us the position of the character in the alphabet.\n\nHere's the Python3 code to solve the problem:\n\n```python\ndef count_char_position(str1: str) -> int:\n    count = 0\n    str1 = str1.lower()  # Convert the string to lowercase\n    for i, char in enumerate(str1):\n        if char.isalpha():  # Check if the character is a letter\n            # Compare the position of the character in the alphabet with its index in the string\n            if ord(char) - ord('a') == i:\n                count += 1\n    return count\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(count_char_position(\"Abcdef\"))  # Output: 3\nprint(count_char_position(\"Algorithms\"))  # Output: 1\n```\n\nThe function `count_char_position` takes a string as input and returns the count of characters that match their position in the alphabet. The `enumerate` function is used to get both the index and the character as we iterate over the string. The `isalpha` method checks if the character is a letter, which is necessary to avoid counting non-alphabetic characters."], "prompt_tokens": [215], "completion_tokens": [880], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": true, "task_id": "mbpp_165_count_char_position"}

The XOR (exclusive OR) operation has the following properties that are relevant to this problem:\n1. XOR of two same numbers is 0 (e.g., `a ^ a = 0`).\n2. XOR of two different numbers is 1 (e.g., `a ^ b = 1` if `a` and `b` are different).\n3. XOR is commutative and associative, which means the order of operations does not change the result (e.g., `a ^ b ^ c = c ^ b ^ a`).\n4. The XOR of a number with 0 is the number itself (e.g., `a ^ 0 = a`).\n\nTo determine if the XOR of two numbers is even, we can use the fact that the least significant bit (LSB) of the XOR result determines its parity (odd or even). If the LSB is 0, the number is even; if the LSB is 1, the number is odd.\n\n## Tutorial:\nThe XOR operation is a bitwise operation that operates on the binary representation of numbers. It compares each bit of the numbers and outputs 1 if the bits are different and 0 if they are the same. Here's a brief tutorial on how to use XOR in competitive programming:\n\n1. Counting Bits: You can use XOR to count the number of set bits (1s) in a binary representation of a number.\n2. Finding Unique Elements: In a collection where every element appears twice except for one, you can find the unique element by XORing all elements together.\n3. Swapping Values: You can swap two integer variables without using a temporary variable by using XOR.\n4. Checking Parity: As mentioned earlier, you can check the parity of the XOR of two numbers by examining the LSB.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Single Number**: Given a non-empty array of integers where every element appears twice except for one, find that single one. The solution is to XOR all the elements. The result is the single number because duplicates will cancel each other out.\n2. **Missing Number**: Given an array containing `n` distinct numbers taken from `0, 1, 2, ..., n`, find the one that is missing from the array. The solution is to XOR all the indices with all the numbers. The result will be the missing number.\n3. **Swap Numbers**: Write a function to swap two numbers without using a temporary variable. The solution is to use XOR operation three times.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\nTo solve the original problem, we can iterate through all possible pairs of numbers in the list and XOR them. If the result is even, we increment our count. To check if a number is even, we can use the bitwise AND operation with 1 (i.e., `num & 1`).

The two main algorithms or methods that can be used are:\n\n1. Bitwise Left Shift: Since powers of 2 in binary representation are just a 1 followed by zeros, we can keep shifting the number 1 to the left until we find a number greater than or equal to `n`.\n\n2. Logarithms: By using the property that the logarithm (base 2) of a power of 2 is an integer, we can calculate the ceiling of the log base 2 of `n` to find the smallest power of 2 greater than or equal to `n`.\n\n## Tutorial:\n### Bitwise Left Shift:\nIn many programming languages, bitwise operations are a fast and efficient way to manipulate individual bits of a number. The left shift operator (`<<`) shifts the bits of a number to the left by a specified number of positions. For example, `1 << 2` would shift the number `1` (binary `0001`) two positions to the left, resulting in `4` (binary `0100`), which is 2 to the power of 2.\n\nTo find the next power of 2, we can start with the number 1 and keep shifting it to the left until the result is greater than or equal to `n`.\n\n### Logarithms:\nThe logarithm of a number `x` in base `b` is the power to which `b` must be raised to produce `x`. In Python, we can use the `math` module to calculate logarithms. The `math.log(x, b)` function returns the logarithm of `x` in base `b`. To find the next power of 2, we can calculate `math.ceil(math.log(n, 2))`, which gives us the smallest integer greater than or equal to the log base 2 of `n`. Raising 2 to this power will give us the desired result.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Reverse Bits**: Given an unsigned integer, reverse all bits of it and return the number with reversed bits.\n   - Solution: Use bitwise operations to iterate over each bit, and construct the reversed number bit by bit.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def reverse_bits(n):\n         result = 0\n         for i in range(32):  # Assuming a 32-bit unsigned integer\n             result = (result << 1) | (n & 1)\n             n >>= 1\n         return result\n     ```\n\n2. **Counting Bits**: Given a non-negative integer `n`, return the number of '1' bits it has (also known as the Hamming weight).\n   - Solution: Use bitwise operations to check each bit and count the number of 1s.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def hammingWeight(n):\n         count = 0\n         while n:\n             count += n & 1\n             n >>= 1\n         return count\n     ```\n\n3. **Power of Four**: Given an integer, write a function to determine if it is a power of 4.\n   - Solution: Check if the number is a power of 2 first, and then ensure that the only set bit is in the even position.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def isPowerOfFour(num):\n         return num != 0 and ((num & (num - 1)) == 0) and (num & 0x55555555) != 0\n     ```\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n### Explanation of the solution:\nWe will use the logarithm method to solve this problem.

The simplest way to do this is by using a loop to iterate through each element of the list and increment a counter each time the target element is encountered.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide to implementing this:\n1.

In Python, strings are iterable, which means you can use a loop to go through each character one by one.\n\nPattern matching in strings involves finding occurrences of a specific sequence of characters within a larger string. This can be done using a brute-force approach where you check every possible starting position in the string for a match, or by using more sophisticated algorithms like the Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm or the Boyer-Moore algorithm for more efficient searching. However, for this problem, since we are only looking for a fixed, short string ('std'), a simple traversal is sufficient and efficient.\n\nPython provides built-in methods for string manipulation, such as `count()` which can be used to count occurrences of a substring within a string. Alternatively, you can manually implement the counting by checking substrings of the length equal to the target substring starting from each position in the string.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Substring Count**: Given two strings, the task is to find the number of times the second string occurs as a substring in the first string. This can be solved using the `count()` method or by manual traversal and comparison.\n\n2. **Pattern Matching**: Given a text and a pattern, find all occurrences of the pattern in the text. This is a classic problem that can be solved using various pattern matching algorithms like KMP, Rabin-Karp, or simple traversal for small patterns.\n\n3. **Longest Repeating Substring**: Find the longest substring that appears at least twice in a given string.

The algorithm compares the target value to the middle element of the array; if they are not equal, the half in which the target cannot lie is eliminated, and the search continues on the remaining half until the target is found or the remaining half is empty.\n\nHere's how binary search works:\n1.

This operation will flip the least significant set bit to 0. The number of iterations needed to reduce the number to 0 is the number of set bits.\n\nHere's how it works:\n- Let's say `n` is the given number.\n- While `n` is not 0:\n  - Perform `n = n & (n - 1)`.

We create a table that stores the number of set bits for all numbers in a range (e.g., 0 to 255). To count the set bits in a larger number, we divide it into chunks that match the precomputed range and sum the set bits for each chunk using the lookup table.\n\n### Bitwise AND and Right Shift:\nIn this method, we iterate over each bit of the number and check if it is set (i.e., if it is 1):\n- Initialize a count variable to 0.\n- Loop through each bit of the number (until the number is not 0):\n  - If the result of `n & 1` is 1, increment the count.\n  - Right shift the number by 1 bit using `n = n >> 1`.\n- Return the count.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Finding the Only Number with Odd Occurrences**: Given an array where all elements occur an even number of times except one element which occurs an odd number of times, find that element.\n   Solution: Use XOR operation on all elements.

In Python, strings are immutable, meaning that you cannot change them in place. Instead, you create a new string with the desired modifications.\n\nTo solve problems involving string manipulation, you often use loops or string methods. For example, you can use a `for` loop with `range()` to iterate over the indices of a string. The `range()` function can take up to three arguments: start, stop, and step. By using a step of 2, you can iterate over every other index, which is useful for this problem.\n\nHere's a brief tutorial on how to iterate over a string using a `for` loop and `range()`:\n\n```python\nmy_string = \"Hello, World!\"\nfor i in range(0, len(my_string), 2):\n    print(my_string[i])\n```\n\nThis code will print every other character in `my_string`, starting from the first character (at index 0).\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Reverse String**: Given a string, write a function that returns the string in reverse order.\n   - Solution: Iterate over the string in reverse order using a loop or slicing and concatenate the characters.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def reverse_string(s):\n         return s[::-1]\n     ```\n\n2. **Replace Vowels with a Character**: Given a string and a character, write a function that replaces all vowels in the string with the given character.\n   - Solution: Iterate over the string and use a conditional statement to check if the character is a vowel.

The specific operations that are useful for this problem are shifting and masking.\n\n## Tutorial:\nBit manipulation is a powerful tool in programming, allowing for efficient and fast operations at the bit level. Here are some common bitwise operators:\n\n- `&` (bitwise AND): This operator compares each bit of the first operand to the corresponding bit of the second operand. If both bits are 1, the corresponding result bit is set to 1. Otherwise, it is set to 0.\n- `|` (bitwise OR): This operator compares each bit of the first operand to the corresponding bit of the second operand. If either bit is 1, the corresponding result bit is set to 1. Otherwise, it is set to 0.\n- `^` (bitwise XOR): This operator is used to compare two bits. If the compared bits are different, the corresponding result bit is set to 1. Otherwise, it is set to 0.\n- `~` (bitwise NOT): This operator inverts all the bits of the operand.\n- `<<` (left shift): This operator shifts the bits of the first operand to the left by the number of positions specified by the second operand. New bits on the right are filled with 0.\n- `>>` (right shift): This operator shifts the bits of the first operand to the right by the number of positions specified by the second operand. For unsigned numbers, new bits on the left are filled with 0.\n\nTo check if all bits in a given range are set, we can create a mask that has all bits set in the given range and then use the bitwise AND operator to see if the result matches the mask.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Check if a number is a power of two**: A number is a power of two if it has only one bit set. To check this, we can use the expression `n & (n - 1)` which should be zero for powers of two.\n2. **Count the number of set bits in a number**: This can be done using Brian Kernighan\u2019s Algorithm, where we repeatedly flip the least significant set bit and count how many times we perform this operation until the number becomes zero.\n3. **Reverse the bits of a number**: To reverse the bits of a number, we can iterate through the bits of the number and construct the reverse number by shifting and setting bits accordingly.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\nTo check if all bits are set in the given range `[l, r]` of a number `n`, we can create a mask that has bits set only in the specified range. This can be done by shifting `1` left `r` times, subtracting `1`, and then XORing with `1` shifted left `l-1` times and subtracted by `1`. Then we can use the bitwise AND operator with `n` and the mask. If the result is equal to the mask, all bits in the range are set.\n\n```python\ndef all_Bits_Set_In_The_Given_Range(n: int, l: int, r: int) -> bool:\n    # Create a mask with all bits set in the range [l, r]\n    mask = ((1 << r) - 1) ^ ((1 << (l - 1)) - 1)\n    # Check if all bits in the range are set in n\n    return (n & mask) == mask\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(all_Bits_Set_In_The_Given_Range(14, 2, 3))  # Output: True, because 14 in binary is 1110, and bits 2 to 3 are set\nprint(all_Bits_Set_In_The_Given_Range(8, 1, 3))   # Output: False, because 8 in binary is 1000, and bits 1 to 3 are not all set\n```\n\nNote: The function name `all_Bits_Set_In_The_Given_Range` suggests that we are checking if all bits are set, but the description asks to check if all bits are unset.

Stable partitioning is a way to reorder elements in a range so that all elements for which a predicate returns true precede all elements for which the predicate returns false, while preserving the relative order of the elements.\n\n## Tutorial:\n### Two-Pointer Technique:\nThe two-pointer technique is commonly used in array and string problems. It involves creating pointers (usually indices) that represent positions in the array or string and moving them based on certain conditions. This technique can be used to find pairs that sum up to a specific value, merge two sorted arrays, or partition an array.\n\n### Stable Partitioning:\nStable partitioning is a process where elements are reordered based on a given condition, but their relative order is preserved. This is different from unstable partitioning, where the relative order might not be preserved.

Specifically, the task is to iterate over the characters in the string and replace the blank spaces with a specified character. This is a straightforward problem that does not require complex algorithms. The main functions and methods that can be used to solve this problem include:\n\n1. String traversal and concatenation.\n2. The `replace()` method in Python, which is a built-in string method that returns a new string with all occurrences of a substring replaced with another substring.\n\n## Tutorial:\nString manipulation is a common task in programming, and it involves altering the contents of a string in various ways, such as replacing characters, splitting strings into substrings, concatenating multiple strings, etc.\n\nIn Python, strings are immutable, which means that once a string is created, the characters within it cannot be changed. However, you can create a new string based on operations performed on the original string.\n\nOne of the simplest ways to replace characters in a string is by using the `replace()` method. The syntax for this method is as follows:\n\n```python\nnew_string = original_string.replace(old, new, count)\n```\n\n- `original_string` is the string on which the replace operation is performed.\n- `old` is the substring that you want to replace.\n- `new` is the substring that will replace the `old` substring.\n- `count` is an optional argument that specifies the number of occurrences to replace. If omitted, all occurrences will be replaced.\n\nAnother way to replace characters in a string is by iterating over each character and building a new string with the desired changes. This can be done using a loop or a string comprehension.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **URLify**: Given a string and its true length, replace all spaces with '%20'. Assume the string has sufficient space at the end to hold the additional characters.\n\n   Solution: Iterate through the string, and each time you encounter a space, append '%20' to a new string instead of the space. Otherwise, append the current character.\n\n2. **Remove Vowels**: Given a string, write a function to remove all vowels from the string.\n\n   Solution: Iterate through the string, and for each character, check if it is not a vowel. If it is not a vowel, append it to a new string.\n\n3. **Find and Replace Pattern**: Given a string and a pattern, find all occurrences of the pattern in the string and replace them with another specified pattern.\n\n   Solution: Use the `replace()` method to replace all occurrences of the given pattern with the new pattern.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\nThe solution involves using the `replace()` method to replace all occurrences of a space (' ') with the specified character.\n\nHere is the Python3 code to solve the problem:\n\n```python\ndef replace_blank(str1: str, char: str) -> str:\n    \"\"\"\n    Write a function that takes in a string and character, replaces blank spaces in the string with the character, and returns the string.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Use the replace method to replace all blank spaces with the given character\n    return str1.replace(' ', char)\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(replace_blank(\"Hello World\", \"-\"))  # Output: \"Hello-World\"\n```\n\nThis code defines the function `replace_blank` that takes two arguments, `str1` and `char`, and returns a new string with all blank spaces in `str1` replaced by `char`.

For a string of length `n`, there are `n*(n+1)/2` non-empty substrings. This is because for each starting position in the string (there are `n` possible starting positions), there are `n-i` possible ending positions for a substring that starts at position `i` (0-indexed). Summing this up for all starting positions gives us the total number of non-empty substrings.\n\nHere's the breakdown:\n- For the first character, there are `n` possible substrings (the whole string, and then all substrings ending before the last character, and so on).\n- For the second character, there are `n-1` possible substrings (all substrings starting from the second character and ending at any of the remaining characters).\n- This pattern continues until the last character, which is a substring of itself, giving us 1 possible substring.\n\nThe sum of this series is `n + (n-1) + (n-2) + ... + 1`, which is a well-known arithmetic series with the sum `n*(n+1)/2`.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Finding the number of distinct substrings in a string**: This problem requires you to find the number of unique substrings in a given string. A solution to this problem would involve using a Trie data structure or a Suffix Array to efficiently store and count distinct substrings.\n\n2. **Longest Palindromic Substring**: Given a string, find the longest palindromic substring in it.

It is applicable when the problem can be divided into overlapping subproblems that can be solved independently. The key idea is to store the solutions of these subproblems in a table (usually an array or a dictionary) so that when the same subproblem occurs, instead of recomputing its solution, one can simply look up the previously computed solution, thereby saving computation time.\n\nThere are two main approaches to dynamic programming:\n1. Top-down approach (Memoization): This approach involves writing the recursive solution and then storing the results of the subproblems in a table (usually a hash table). The algorithm first checks if the solution to the subproblem is already in the table before computing it.\n2. Bottom-up approach (Tabulation): This approach involves filling up a DP table by solving the smallest subproblems first and using their solutions to build up solutions to larger subproblems.\n\nFor the given problem, we can use either approach to count the number of valid sequences. We will define a recursive function that counts the number of sequences starting with a particular number and then use memoization to avoid redundant calculations.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. Fibonacci Sequence: Given `n`, calculate the `n`th Fibonacci number. The Fibonacci sequence is a classic example where dynamic programming can be used to reduce the time complexity from exponential to linear by storing the results of the subproblems.\n2. Longest Increasing Subsequence: Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest increasing subsequence. This problem can be solved using dynamic programming by keeping track of the longest subsequence that can be formed with each element as the last element.\n3. Coin Change Problem: Given an unlimited supply of coins of given denominations and a total amount of money, count the number of ways to make the change for the given amount. This problem can be solved using dynamic programming by building a table that represents the number of ways to make each amount using the given coins.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\nTo solve the original problem, we will use a top-down dynamic programming approach with memoization. We will define a recursive function `count_sequences(start, length)` that returns the number of valid sequences of a given length that start with a particular number `start`. We will use a dictionary to memoize the results of subproblems to avoid redundant calculations.\n\nHere's the Python3 code to solve the problem:\n\n```python\ndef get_total_number_of_sequences(m: int, n: int) -> int:\n    memo = {}\n\n    def count_sequences(start, length):\n        if length == 0:\n            return 1\n        if (start, length) in memo:\n            return memo[(start, length)]\n        \n        ways = 0\n        next_start = max(start * 2, 1)\n        while next_start <= m:\n            ways += count_sequences(next_start, length - 1)\n            next_start += 1\n        \n        memo[(start, length)] = ways\n        return ways\n\n    return count_sequences(0, n)\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(get_total_number_of_sequences(5, 2))  # Output should be the number of valid sequences\n```\n\nIn this code, `count_sequences` is a helper function that uses memoization to store the results of subproblems in the `memo` dictionary. The function iterates over all possible starting values for the next element in the sequence and recursively counts the number of valid sequences from that starting point.

The maximum sum of a bitonic subsequence can then be found by combining these two results.\n\n## Tutorial:\nDynamic programming is a method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems. It is applicable when the problem can be divided into overlapping subproblems that can be solved independently.\n\nFor the LIS part, we iterate through the array and for each element, we find the maximum sum of the increasing subsequence that ends with that element. This is done by looking at all previous elements that are smaller and adding the current element to the maximum sum found so far.\n\nFor the LDS part, we do a similar process but in reverse, starting from the end of the array and moving towards the beginning. We look for elements that are smaller than the current one to find the maximum sum of the decreasing subsequence starting with that element.\n\nFinally, to find the maximum sum of a bitonic subsequence, we combine the results from the LIS and LDS passes.

The maximum of these sums across all elements is the result.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Longest Bitonic Subsequence**: Given an array of integers, find the length of the longest bitonic subsequence.

Initialize a 2D array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the length of the longest palindromic subsequence in the substring `str[i...j]`.\n2. Fill in the base cases: for all `i`, `dp[i][i] = 1` since every single character is a palindrome of length 1.\n3. Fill in the table in a bottom-up manner. For each substring length `l` from 2 to the length of the string, and for each starting index `i`, calculate the ending index `j = i + l - 1` and do the following:\n   - If `str[i] == str[j]`, then `dp[i][j] = dp[i+1][j-1] + 2` because the characters at `i` and `j` can be added to the longest palindromic subsequence of the substring `str[i+1...j-1]`.\n   - If `str[i] != str[j]`, then `dp[i][j] = max(dp[i+1][j], dp[i][j-1])` because we need to take the maximum length from either excluding the character at `i` or excluding the character at `j`.\n4. The answer will be in `dp[0][n-1]`, where `n` is the length of the string.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Longest Common Subsequence**: Given two strings, find the length of the longest subsequence present in both of them. The solution involves creating a 2D array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the length of the longest common subsequence of the strings up to `i` and `j`. The dynamic programming approach is similar to the longest palindromic subsequence but compares characters from two different strings.\n\n2. **Palindrome Partitioning II**: Given a string, partition it such that every substring of the partition is a palindrome. Return the minimum number of cuts needed for a palindrome partitioning. This problem can be solved using dynamic programming by first determining palindromic substrings and then finding the minimum cuts needed.\n\n3. **Edit Distance**: Given two strings, compute the minimum number of operations required to convert one string into the other. The operations can include insertions, deletions, or substitutions of characters. Dynamic programming is used to build a table that represents the edit distances between all prefixes of the two strings.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\nWe will implement the dynamic programming approach described above to solve the problem of finding the length of the longest palindromic subsequence.\n\n```python\ndef lps(str: str) -> int:\n    n = len(str)\n    # Create a 2D array to store the lengths of palindromic subsequences\n    dp = [[0 for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(n)]\n    \n    # Every single character is a palindrome of length 1\n    for i in range(n):\n        dp[i][i] = 1\n    \n    # Build the table in a bottom-up manner\n    for l in range(2, n+1):  # l is the length of the substring\n        for i in range(n-l+1):\n            j = i + l - 1  # Ending index of the substring\n            if str[i] == str[j]:\n                dp[i][j] = dp[i+1][j-1] + 2\n            else:\n                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i+1][j], dp[i][j-1])\n    \n    # The length of the longest palindromic subsequence is in dp[0][n-1]\n    return dp[0][n-1]\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(lps(\"bbbab\"))  # Output: 4 (\"bbbb\" is the longest palindromic subsequence)\n```\n\nThis code initializes a 2D array `dp` and fills it according to the rules of the dynamic programming approach.

This method is efficient because lookups in a set or dictionary are O(1) on average.\n\n### Sorting and Two Pointers:\nFirst, sort both arrays. Then, use two pointers to iterate through both arrays simultaneously. When elements at both pointers match, that's an intersection. Move both pointers. If the element at the first pointer is smaller, move the first pointer forward. If the element at the second pointer is smaller, move the second pointer forward. This method is efficient if the arrays are already sorted or if the sorting overhead is acceptable.\n\n### Binary Search:\nIf one array is significantly smaller than the other and both are sorted, it might be more efficient to perform a binary search for each element of the smaller array in the larger array.

It is the simplest search algorithm and has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements in the list.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide to implementing a linear search to count occurrences of an element:\n1.

This can be solved using Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm, but a simple linear search can also be used to count occurrences of each element and find the majority.\n\n2. **Counting Elements in Two Arrays**: Given two arrays, count the number of times each element of the first array occurs in the second array.

The algorithm to solve this problem is straightforward and does not require any advanced techniques. It involves iterating over the list and inserting the new element before each existing element.\n\n## Tutorial:\nList manipulation is a common task in programming. Python provides a variety of methods to manipulate lists, such as `append()`, `extend()`, `insert()`, `remove()`, and `pop()`. For this problem, we will focus on the `insert()` method.\n\nThe `insert()` method takes two arguments: the index at which to insert the item and the item to insert. The syntax is as follows:\n```python\nlist.insert(index, item)\n```\n\nWhen inserting an element before each element in a list, we need to be careful with the indices because the list size changes as we insert new elements. One way to handle this is to iterate over the list in reverse order, which ensures that the insertion does not affect the indices of the elements yet to be processed.\n\nAnother approach is to create a new list and add the new element followed by the existing element in each iteration. This avoids the issue of changing indices altogether.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Duplicate Zeros**: Given a fixed-length integer array `arr`, duplicate each occurrence of zero, shifting the remaining elements to the right. You need to modify the input array in-place with O(1) extra space.\n   \n   Solution: Iterate through the array in reverse order. When a zero is encountered, shift all elements to the right and insert an additional zero.\n\n2. **Merge Sorted Array**: Given two sorted integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, merge `nums2` into `nums1` as one sorted array. The number of elements initialized in `nums1` and `nums2` are `m` and `n` respectively. You may assume that `nums1` has enough space to hold additional elements from `nums2`.\n\n   Solution: Start from the end of both arrays and compare elements, placing the larger one at the end of `nums1`. Continue until all elements from `nums2` are merged.\n\n3. **Create Target Array in the Given Order**: Given two arrays `nums` and `index`, create a target array under the following rules: Initially, the target array is empty. From left to right, read nums[i] and index[i], and insert the value at nums[i] into target at index[i]. Repeat the steps until there are no elements to read in nums and index.\n\n   Solution: Iterate through `nums` and `index` simultaneously, using the `insert()` method to place each element from `nums` into the target array at the corresponding index from `index`.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\nWe will create a new list and iterate over the original list. For each element in the original list, we will first add the new element to the new list and then add the original element.

This is an ancient algorithm used to find all prime numbers up to any given limit. It does so by iteratively marking the multiples of each prime number starting from 2.\n\n## Tutorial:\nThe Sieve of Eratosthenes works as follows:\n\n1. Create a list of consecutive integers from 2 to n: (2, 3, 4, ..., n).\n2. Initially, let p equal 2, the first prime number.\n3. Starting from p^2, count up in increments of p and mark each of these numbers greater than or equal to p^2 itself in the list. These numbers will be p^2, p^2+p, p^2+2p, ..., which are all multiples of p (and are not prime).\n4. Find the first number greater than p in the list that is not marked. If there was no such number, stop. Otherwise, let p now equal this new number (which is the next prime), and repeat from step 3.\n5. When the algorithm terminates, all the unmarked numbers in the list are prime.\n\nThe Sieve of Eratosthenes is efficient for finding all primes below 10 million or so (complexity: O(n log log n)).\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Problem**: Find the sum of all primes below two million.\n   **Solution**: Use the Sieve of Eratosthenes to generate all prime numbers below two million and then sum them up.\n   **Python3 code**:\n   ```python\n   def sum_primes_below(n):\n       sieve = [True] * n\n       for p in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):\n           if sieve[p]:\n               for i in range(p*p, n, p):\n                   sieve[i] = False\n       return sum(p for p in range(2, n) if sieve[p])\n   ```\n\n2. **Problem**: Check if a number is prime.\n   **Solution**: Use a modified version of the Sieve of Eratosthenes or trial division to check if the number has any divisors.\n   **Python3 code**:\n   ```python\n   def is_prime(n):\n       if n <= 1:\n           return False\n       if n <= 3:\n           return True\n       if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:\n           return False\n       i = 5\n       while i * i <= n:\n           if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:\n               return False\n           i += 6\n       return True\n   ```\n\n3. **Problem**: Find the smallest number divisible by each of the numbers 1 to 20.\n   **Solution**: Use prime factorization and the Sieve of Eratosthenes to find all prime factors of numbers from 1 to 20, then calculate the least common multiple (LCM).\n   **Python3 code**:\n   ```python\n   def smallest_multiple(n):\n       sieve = [True] * (n+1)\n       result = 1\n       for p in range(2, n+1):\n           if sieve[p]:\n               count = 1\n               while p**count <= n:\n                   count += 1\n               result *= p**(count-1)\n               for i in range(p*2, n+1, p):\n                   sieve[i] = False\n       return result\n   ```\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n- Explanation of the solution:\n  We will use the Sieve of Eratosthenes to mark all non-prime numbers.

It is a straightforward task that involves swapping two values. The core concept here is simply understanding how to manipulate variables in Python.\n\n## Tutorial:\nSwapping two variables in Python can be done in several ways. The most common and Pythonic way is to use tuple unpacking, which allows you to swap values without the need for a temporary variable. Here's how it works:\n\n```python\na, b = b, a\n```\n\nThis line of code creates a tuple `(b, a)` on the right-hand side and then unpacks it into the variables `a` and `b` on the left-hand side, effectively swapping their values.\n\nAnother way to swap variables involves using a temporary variable:\n\n```python\ntemp = a\na = b\nb = temp\n```\n\nThis method is more verbose and less Pythonic, but it achieves the same result.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Reverse Array**: Given an array of integers, write a function that reverses the array.\n   - Solution: Iterate over the array and swap elements at symmetric positions from the start and end until the middle is reached.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def reverse_array(arr):\n         left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1\n         while left < right:\n             arr[left], arr[right] = arr[right], arr[left]\n             left += 1\n             right -= 1\n         return arr\n     ```\n\n2. **Rotate Array**: Given an array, rotate the array to the right by k steps, where k is non-negative.\n   - Solution: Reverse the whole array, then reverse the first k elements, and finally reverse the rest of the array.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def rotate_array(nums, k):\n         k %= len(nums)\n         nums[:] = nums[::-1]\n         nums[:k] = nums[:k][::-1]\n         nums[k:] = nums[k:][::-1]\n     ```\n\n3. **Next Permutation**: Implement next permutation, which rearranges numbers into the lexicographically next greater permutation of numbers.\n   - Solution: Find the first decreasing element from the end, swap it with the just larger element found to its right, and then reverse the sequence after the original decreasing element.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def next_permutation(nums):\n         i = j = len(nums) - 1\n         while i > 0 and nums[i - 1] >= nums[i]:\n             i -= 1\n         if i == 0:   # nums are in descending order\n             nums.reverse()\n             return\n         k = i - 1    # find the last \"ascending\" position\n         while nums[j] <= nums[k]:\n             j -= 1\n         nums[k], nums[j] = nums[j], nums[k]\n         nums[k + 1:] = reversed(nums[k + 1:])\n     ```\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n- Explanation of the solution:\n  The solution is straightforward.

In this case, we are performing division. Element-wise operations are common in array, list, or tuple manipulation, where you apply a mathematical operation to corresponding elements of two sequences.\n\n## Tutorial:\nElement-wise operations are straightforward. You take two sequences (arrays, lists, or tuples) of the same length and apply a binary operation (like addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division) to each pair of corresponding elements. For example, if you have two lists `a = [a1, a2, a3]` and `b = [b1, b2, b3]`, the element-wise sum would be `[a1+b1, a2+b2, a3+b3]`.\n\nIn Python, element-wise operations can be performed using list comprehensions, the `zip` function, or libraries like NumPy which are designed for numerical computations.\n\nHere's a simple example using list comprehension and `zip` to perform element-wise addition:\n\n```python\na = [1, 2, 3]\nb = [4, 5, 6]\nresult = [x + y for x, y in zip(a, b)]\nprint(result)  # Output: [5, 7, 9]\n```\n\nFor division, you need to be careful with division by zero, which is undefined. In competitive programming, you'll often need to handle such edge cases to avoid runtime errors.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Vector Addition**: Given two vectors represented as lists, find their sum.\n   Solution: Use element-wise addition.\n   ```python\n   def vector_addition(v1, v2):\n       return [x + y for x, y in zip(v1, v2)]\n   ```\n\n2. **Dot Product**: Given two vectors, compute their dot product.\n   Solution: Multiply corresponding elements and sum the results.\n   ```python\n   def dot_product(v1, v2):\n       return sum(x * y for x, y in zip(v1, v2))\n   ```\n\n3. **Scaling a Vector**: Given a vector and a scalar, multiply each element of the vector by the scalar.\n   Solution: Use list comprehension to multiply each element by the scalar.\n   ```python\n   def scale_vector(scalar, vector):\n       return [scalar * x for x in vector]\n   ```\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\nThe solution involves iterating over both tuples simultaneously, dividing the corresponding elements from the first tuple by the elements of the second tuple.

List slicing is a technique that allows us to extract certain elements from a list by specifying a range of indices. The syntax for list slicing is `list[start:stop]`, where `start` is the index of the first element to include and `stop` is the index of the first element to exclude.\n\n## Tutorial:\nList slicing is a powerful feature in Python that enables you to retrieve a subset of elements from a list. Here's a brief tutorial on how to use list slicing:\n\n- To get a slice of a list from the start index `i` to the end index `j` (exclusive), you use the syntax `list[i:j]`.\n- If you omit the start index (i.e., `list[:j]`), the slice starts from the beginning of the list.\n- If you omit the end index (i.e., `list[i:]`), the slice goes until the end of the list.\n- Negative indices can be used to count from the end of the list. For example, `list[-3:]` would return the last three elements of the list.\n- You can also specify a step (i.e., `list[i:j:k]`), which determines the interval between elements in the slice.\n\nHere's an example of list slicing:\n\n```python\nmy_list = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\nslice1 = my_list[2:5]  # This will be [2, 3, 4]\nslice2 = my_list[:3]   # This will be [0, 1, 2]\nslice3 = my_list[5:]   # This will be [5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\nslice4 = my_list[-4:]  # This will be [6, 7, 8, 9]\nslice5 = my_list[::2]  # This will be [0, 2, 4, 6, 8]\n```\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Rotate Array**: Given an array, rotate the array to the right by `k` steps, where `k` is non-negative.\n   - Solution: To rotate the array, you can use slicing to divide the array into two parts and then concatenate them in the reverse order.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def rotate_array(nums, k):\n         n = len(nums)\n         k %= n  # In case k is larger than the array size\n         nums[:] = nums[-k:] + nums[:-k]\n         return nums\n     ```\n\n2. **Partition Labels**: A string `S` of lowercase English letters is given. We want to partition this string into as many parts as possible so that each letter appears in at most one part, and return a list of integers representing the size of these parts.\n   - Solution: You can use a hashmap to store the last occurrence of each character, then use two pointers to create the partitions based on the maximum last occurrence of the characters within the current partition.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def partition_labels(S):\n         last = {c: i for i, c in enumerate(S)}\n         j = anchor = 0\n         ans = []\n         for i, c in enumerate(S):\n             j = max(j, last[c])\n             if i == j:\n                 ans.append(i - anchor + 1)\n                 anchor = i + 1\n         return ans\n     ```\n\n3. **Merge Intervals**: Given a collection of intervals, merge all overlapping intervals.\n   - Solution: First, sort the intervals by their start times. Then, iterate through the sorted intervals, and if the current interval overlaps with the previous one, merge them; otherwise, add the current interval to the result.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def merge_intervals(intervals):\n         intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])\n         merged = []\n         for interval in intervals:\n             if not merged or merged[-1][1] < interval[0]:\n                 merged.append(interval)\n             else:\n                 merged[-1][1] = max(merged[-1][1], interval[1])\n         return merged\n     ```\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n- Explanation of the solution:\n  The solution involves using list slicing to split the list into two parts. The first part will have elements from the beginning of the list up to the `L`th element (exclusive), and the second part will contain the rest of the list.\n\n- Python3 code to solve the problem:\n  ```python\n  from typing import List, Any\n\n  def split_two_parts(list1: List[Any], L: int) -> Any:\n      \"\"\"\n      Write a function that takes in a list and an integer L and splits the given list into two parts where the length of the first part of the list is L, and returns the resulting lists in a tuple.\n      \"\"\"\n      return (list1[:L], list1[L:])\n\n  # Example usage:\n  my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n  print(split_two_parts(my_list, 3))  # Output: ([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6])\n  ```\nThis code will correctly split the input list into two parts as specified and return them in a tuple."], "prompt_tokens": [239], "completion_tokens": [1151], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": false, "task_id": "mbpp_262_split_two_parts"}

Understand the conversion rule or formula.\n2. Apply the rule to the input value.\n3. Return or print the result.\n\nIn Python, this can be done using simple arithmetic operations. You can use conditional statements (if-else) to apply different conversion rates depending on the input.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Cat Age Calculator**: Similar to the dog age problem, write a function to calculate a cat's age in cat years. The first two years of a cat's life count for 24 human years, and each year after counts as 4 human years.\n\n2. **Rabbit Age Calculator**: Write a function to calculate a rabbit's age.

The index starts at 0 for the first item.\n\nFor example, if you have a tuple `t = (1, 'a', 2)`, you can access the first item with `t[0]`, which will give you `1`, and the last item with `t[2]`, which will give you `2`.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Extracting Even Numbers**: Given a list of numbers, write a function to return a list of even numbers.\n   - Solution: Use list comprehension to iterate through the list and use the modulo operator to check if the number is even.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def extract_even_numbers(numbers):\n         return [num for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0]\n     ```\n\n2. **Selecting Tuple Elements**: Given a list of tuples, write a function to return a list of the second elements of each tuple.\n   - Solution: Use list comprehension to iterate through the list and access the second element of each tuple using indexing.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def select_second_elements(tuples):\n         return [t[1] for t in tuples]\n     ```\n\n3. **Filtering by Tuple Attribute**: Given a list of tuples representing products and their prices, write a function to return a list of products with a price greater than 100.\n   - Solution: Use list comprehension to iterate through the list, access the price in each tuple, and filter based on the price.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def expensive_products(products):\n         return [product for product, price in products if price > 100]\n     ```\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n- Explanation of the solution:\n  The solution involves iterating over the list of tuples and accessing the last element of each tuple using the index `-1`.

The steps for the sequential search algorithm are as follows:\n\n1. Start from the first element of the list.\n2. Compare the current element with the target value.\n3. If the current element matches the target value, return the index of the element and `True`.\n4. If the current element does not match, move to the next element.\n5.

If the target is not found in the list, return `-1` and `False`.\n\nThe time complexity of the sequential search algorithm is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the list. This is because, in the worst case, you may have to look at every element once.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Finding the Maximum Value in a List**: Given a list of integers, find the maximum value. You would iterate through the list, keeping track of the maximum value found so far.\n\n2. **Checking for Duplicates**: Given a list of integers, determine if there are any duplicates. You would use a nested loop where for each element, you sequentially search through the rest of the list to see if a duplicate exists.\n\n3. **Finding the First Repeating Element**: Given a list of integers, find the first element that repeats. You would iterate through the list and use a set to keep track of the elements you've seen.

The two common approaches are:\n\n1. **Hash Set**: A hash set (in Python, a `set`) can be used to store elements. Since sets do not allow duplicate values, we can iterate over the list and try to add each element to the set. If an element is already in the set, it means we've encountered a duplicate.\n\n2. **Sorting**: Another approach is to sort the list first, which brings duplicates next to each other. Then, we can iterate through the sorted list and check if any adjacent elements are the same, indicating a duplicate.\n\n## Tutorial:\n### Hash Set Method:\nA hash set is a data structure that stores a collection of unique items. It has an average-case time complexity of O(1) for insertion and lookup operations, which makes it very efficient for checking duplicates.\n\nHere's how you can use a hash set to check for uniqueness:\n- Initialize an empty set.\n- Iterate over each element in the list.\n- For each element, check if it is already in the set.\n- If it is, return `False` because a duplicate has been found.\n- If it is not, add the element to the set.\n- If the loop completes without finding any duplicates, return `True`.\n\n### Sorting Method:\nThe sorting method involves sorting the list first and then checking for duplicates in adjacent elements.\n\nHere's the process:\n- Sort the list.\n- Iterate over the list and compare each element with the next one.\n- If any two adjacent elements are equal, return `False`.\n- If no duplicates are found, return `True`.\n\nThe time complexity of this method depends on the sorting algorithm used. For example, if the sorting algorithm is O(n log n), then the overall time complexity will also be O(n log n).\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Finding Duplicate in an Array**: Given an array of integers, find if the array contains any duplicates. Your function should return true if any value appears at least twice in the array, and it should return false if every element is distinct.\n\n   Solution: Use a hash set to track seen elements. If an element is already in the set, return `True`. If the loop completes, return `False`.\n\n2. **Two Sum Unique Pairs**: Given an array of integers and a target value, find all unique pairs of integers that sum up to the target value. Each pair should be counted only once, even if they occur more than once in the array.\n\n   Solution: Sort the array and use two pointers to find pairs that sum up to the target. Use a set to ensure pairs are unique.\n\n3. **Longest Consecutive Sequence**: Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.\n\n   Solution: Use a hash set to store all elements. Then, iterate over the array, and for each element, if it's the start of a sequence (i.e., `element-1` is not in the set), count the length of the consecutive sequence by incrementing from the element until the next number is not in the set.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\nWe will use the hash set method to solve this problem. We will iterate over the list and add each element to a set. If we find that an element is already in the set, we will return `False`.

Common quantifiers include:\n  - `*`: 0 or more times\n  - `+`: 1 or more times\n  - `?`: 0 or 1 time\n  - `{n}`: exactly n times\n  - `{n,}`: n or more times\n  - `{n,m}`: between n and m times (inclusive)\n- Character classes: allow you to match any one of several characters. For example, `[abc]` matches any one of the characters 'a', 'b', or 'c'.\n- Special sequences: represent predefined sets of characters, such as `\\d` for digits, `\\w` for word characters, and `\\s` for whitespace.\n\nTo use regex in Python, you typically compile a pattern using `re.compile()`, and then use methods like `search()`, `match()`, `findall()`, or `sub()` to find or replace text that matches the pattern.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Email Address Validator**: Write a function that checks if a string is a valid email address.\n   - Solution: Use a regex pattern that matches the general structure of an email address, which includes characters for the username, the `@` symbol, and the domain.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     import re\n\n     def is_valid_email(email: str) -> bool:\n         pattern = re.compile(r'^[\\w\\.-]+@[\\w\\.-]+\\.\\w+$')\n         return bool(pattern.match(email))\n     ```\n\n2. **Phone Number Formatter**: Write a function that takes a string containing a 10-digit phone number and formats it as \"(xxx) xxx-xxxx\".\n   - Solution: Use regex to capture three groups of digits and then format them accordingly.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     import re\n\n     def format_phone_number(number: str) -> str:\n         pattern = re.compile(r'(\\d{3})(\\d{3})(\\d{4})')\n         return pattern.sub(r'(\\1) \\2-\\3', number)\n     ```\n\n3. **Password Strength Checker**: Write a function that checks if a password is strong, meaning it has at least 8 characters, including a digit, an uppercase letter, and a lowercase letter.\n   - Solution: Use multiple regex checks to ensure the password meets the criteria.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     import re\n\n     def is_strong_password(password: str) -> bool:\n         length_check = len(password) >= 8\n         digit_check = re.search(r'\\d', password)\n         upper_check = re.search(r'[A-Z]', password)\n         lower_check = re.search(r'[a-z]', password)\n         return all([length_check, digit_check, upper_check, lower_check])\n     ```\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n- Explanation of the solution:\n  To solve the original problem, we will use a regex pattern that looks for the character 'a' followed by either two or three 'b' characters. The pattern for this is `'ab{2,3}'`. The `{2,3}` quantifier means \"match the previous character ('b') at least 2 times and at most 3 times.\"\n\n- Python3 code:\n  ```python\n  import re\n\n  def text_match_two_three(text: str) -> bool:\n      pattern = re.compile(r'ab{2,3}')\n      return bool(pattern.search(text))\n  ```\n\nThis function compiles the regex pattern and then uses the `search()` method to look for any match in the input text. If a match is found, `search()` returns a match object, which is truthy, and the function returns `True`. If no match is found, `search()` returns `None`, which is falsy, and the function returns `False`."], "prompt_tokens": [209], "completion_tokens": [900], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": false, "task_id": "mbpp_285_text_match_two_three"}

However, since the array is repeated `k` times, we need to modify the algorithm to account for the repetition. We also need to consider the total sum of the original array to determine if repeating the entire array contributes to the maximum sum.\n\n## Tutorial:\n**Kadane's Algorithm** is a dynamic programming approach that scans the entire array and at each position finds the maximum subarray sum ending at that position. This is done by keeping track of the current sum and updating the maximum sum found so far. If the current sum becomes negative, it is reset to zero.\n\nHere's a step-by-step explanation of Kadane's algorithm:\n1. Initialize two variables: `max_so_far` (the final answer) and `max_ending_here` (maximum sum of subarray ending at the current index).\n2. Iterate through each element of the array.\n3. Update `max_ending_here` by adding the current element to it.\n4. If `max_ending_here` becomes negative, set it to zero.\n5. Update `max_so_far` if `max_ending_here` is greater than `max_so_far`.\n6. Continue to the next element.\n\nFor the modified problem where the array is repeated `k` times, we need to consider the following cases:\n- If the total sum of the original array is negative, we only need to consider the maximum subarray sum of one instance of the array, as repeating the array will not increase the sum.\n- If the total sum is positive, the maximum sum can be obtained by concatenating the maximum suffix sum of the first array, the total sum multiplied by (k-2), and the maximum prefix sum of the last array.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Maximum Subarray**: Given an integer array `nums`, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum. This is the classic problem that Kadane's algorithm solves.\n\n2. **Maximum Sum Circular Subarray**: Similar to the maximum subarray problem, but the array is circular, which means wrapping is allowed. The solution involves finding the maximum subarray sum using Kadane's algorithm twice, once on the original array and once on the inverted array to find the maximum sum that wraps around.\n\n3. **Maximum Product Subarray**: Find the contiguous subarray within an array (containing at least one number) which has the largest product. This problem is a variation of the maximum subarray problem and can be solved using a modified version of Kadane's algorithm that keeps track of both the maximum and minimum products.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef max_sub_array_sum_repeated(a: List[int], n: int, k: int) -> int:\n    def kadane(arr):\n        max_ending_here = max_so_far = arr[0]\n        for x in arr[1:]:\n            max_ending_here = max(x, max_ending_here + x)\n            max_so_far = max(max_so_far, max_ending_here)\n        return max_so_far\n\n    # Find the maximum subarray sum for one instance of the array\n    max_kadane = kadane(a)\n    \n    # Calculate the sum of the entire array\n    array_sum = sum(a)\n    \n    # If k is 1, we don't need to repeat the array\n    if k == 1:\n        return max_kadane\n    \n    # Calculate the maximum prefix and suffix sums\n    max_prefix_sum = max_suffix_sum = curr_prefix_sum = curr_suffix_sum = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        curr_prefix_sum += a[i]\n        max_prefix_sum = max(max_prefix_sum, curr_prefix_sum)\n        \n    for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):\n        curr_suffix_sum += a[i]\n        max_suffix_sum = max(max_suffix_sum, curr_suffix_sum)\n    \n    # If the sum of the array is negative, the answer is either the max subarray sum\n    # or the sum of the max prefix and suffix of the array\n    if array_sum < 0:\n        return max(max_kadane, max_prefix_sum + max_suffix_sum)\n    \n    # If the sum is positive, we can add the sum of the array (k-2) times\n    return max(max_kadane, max_prefix_sum + array_sum * (k-2) + max_suffix_sum)\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(max_sub_array_sum_repeated([1, -2, 1], 3, 2))  # Output: 2\n```\n\nExplanation of the solution:\n- We first use Kadane's algorithm to find the maximum subarray sum for one instance of the array.\n- We calculate the total sum of the array to determine if repeating the array will contribute to the maximum sum.\n- We find the maximum prefix and suffix sums which will be useful if the array sum is negative or if we need to concatenate the array.\n- We then consider the cases based on the sign of the total sum of the array and calculate the maximum sum accordingly."], "prompt_tokens": [228], "completion_tokens": [1093], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": false, "task_id": "mbpp_286_max_sub_array_sum_repeated"}

We can approach this by considering the number of ways to paint the last two posts with the same or different colors and then build up the solution from there.\n\n## Tutorial:\nDynamic programming problems typically involve a few key steps:\n\n1. **Define the subproblems**: Break the main problem into smaller, overlapping subproblems.\n2. **Write down the recurrence that relates subproblems**: Find a way to express the solution to the problem in terms of solutions to smaller subproblems.\n3. **Solve the base cases**: Identify and solve the simplest subproblems, which serve as the base cases for the recurrence.\n4. **Solve the larger problems using the recurrence**: Use the recurrence to find the solution to larger subproblems until you solve the original problem.\n\nFor the fence painting problem, we can define our subproblems as follows:\n\n- Let `same[i]` be the number of ways to paint `i` posts where the last two posts are painted with the same color.\n- Let `diff[i]` be the number of ways to paint `i` posts where the last two posts are painted with different colors.\n\nThe base cases are:\n- `same[2] = k` (since there are `k` ways to paint two posts with the same color)\n- `diff[2] = k * (k-1)` (since there are `k` choices for the first post and `k-1` choices for the second post)\n\nThe recurrence relations are:\n- `same[i] = diff[i-1]` (the last two posts can only be the same color if the previous two were different)\n- `diff[i] = (same[i-1] + diff[i-1]) * (k-1)` (the last post can be any of the `k-1` colors different from the second-to-last post)\n\nFinally, the total number of ways to paint `n` posts is `same[n] + diff[n]`.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Coin Change Problem**: Given an unlimited supply of coins of given denominations, find the total number of distinct ways to get a desired change.\n   Solution: Use dynamic programming to build up the solution from smaller to larger amounts of change.\n   \n2. **Longest Increasing Subsequence**: Find the length of the longest subsequence of a given sequence such that all elements of the subsequence are sorted in increasing order.\n   Solution: Use dynamic programming to keep track of the longest increasing subsequence ending at each element.\n\n3. **0/1 Knapsack Problem**: Given weights and values of `n` items, put these items in a knapsack of capacity `W` to get the maximum total value in the knapsack.\n   Solution: Use dynamic programming to consider each item and decide whether to include it in the knapsack or not, based on the maximum value obtained.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\nWe will use dynamic programming to solve this problem.

Integer division is a basic arithmetic operation where the division of two integers results in an integer quotient without the remainder. In Python, this operation is performed using the `//` operator.\n\n## Tutorial:\nInteger division is a fundamental operation in many programming languages. In Python, the `//` operator is used to perform integer division. When you divide two integers using the `//` operator, the result is the quotient rounded down to the nearest integer. This is also known as floor division.\n\nHere's how it works:\n- If both numbers are positive, the result is the number of times the divisor fits into the dividend.\n- If one or both numbers are negative, the result is the quotient rounded down to the nearest integer that is less than or equal to the actual quotient.\n\nFor example:\n- `5 // 2` would give `2` because `2` fits into `5` two times.\n- `-5 // 2` would give `-3` because `-3` is the nearest integer less than the actual quotient `-2.5`.\n- `5 // -2` would give `-3` for the same reason as above.\n- `-5 // -2` would give `2` because `-2` fits into `-5` two times.\n\nIt's important to note that integer division is different from the modulo operation, which returns the remainder of the division.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Divide Two Integers Without Using Multiplication, Division, and Mod Operator**: Given two integers dividend and divisor, divide two integers without using multiplication, division, and mod operator. Return the quotient after dividing dividend by divisor.\n\n   Solution: This problem can be solved by subtracting the divisor from the dividend repeatedly until the dividend is less than the divisor. The number of times we can do this subtraction is the quotient.\n\n2. **Compute Power of a Number**: Given two integers `x` and `n`, compute `x` raised to the power `n`. This can be done efficiently using the concept of exponentiation by squaring.\n\n   Solution: The idea is to square the number and divide the exponent by 2 repeatedly to reduce the problem size. When the exponent is odd, we multiply the current result by the base number.\n\n3. **Find the Kth Largest Element in an Array**: Given an unsorted array and an integer `k`, find the kth largest element in the array.\n\n   Solution: This problem can be solved using a sorting algorithm or a selection algorithm like QuickSelect, which is based on the partitioning used in QuickSort.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\nThe solution to the original problem is straightforward.

The modified merge sort algorithm efficiently counts the number of inversions while sorting the array.\n\n## Tutorial:\nThe merge sort algorithm is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that divides the array into two halves, recursively sorts each half, and then merges the sorted halves. To count inversions, we modify the merge step to include a counter for the number of inversions.\n\nDuring the merge step, when we pick an element from the right half that is smaller than the left half, it means that this element is inverted with all the remaining elements in the left half (since the left half is already sorted). We can increment our inversion count by the number of remaining elements in the left half at that point.\n\nHere's a step-by-step process:\n1. Divide the array into two halves.\n2. Recursively count inversions in the left half.\n3. Recursively count inversions in the right half.\n4. Count inversions while merging the two halves and add this count to the counts from step 2 and 3.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Counting Inversions using BIT (Binary Indexed Tree)**: Similar to the merge sort inversion count, but using a BIT to count inversions.

The number of swaps required is the sum of the sizes of the cycles minus the number of cycles.\n\n3. **Find the Smallest Missing Positive Number**: This problem can be solved by first placing each number in its correct position if possible (i.e., number `i` in index `i-1`), and then the first place where the number is not correct gives the smallest missing positive number. While doing this, we can also count inversions as a side effect.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\nWe will implement the modified merge sort algorithm to count inversions.

Recursion is a method of solving a problem where the solution depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem. In the context of flattening a list, recursion can be used to iterate through the list and whenever a nested list is encountered, the function calls itself with the nested list as the new input.\n\n## Tutorial:\nRecursion involves a function calling itself with a different input. In the case of flattening a list, the recursive function should do the following:\n\n1. Initialize an empty list that will contain the flattened result.\n2. Iterate through each element in the input list.\n3. If an element is an integer, append it to the result list.\n4. If an element is a list, recursively call the flatten function on this nested list and extend the result list with the returned flattened list.\n5. Return the result list.\n\nThe base case for the recursion is when the input is no longer a list but an integer, at which point the recursion stops.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Deep Flatten a List**: Given a list that may contain multiple levels of nested lists, write a function to flatten it into a single list with all the elements in their original order.\n   - Solution: Use recursion to handle arbitrary levels of nesting. Each time a nested list is encountered, the function calls itself with this list.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def deep_flatten(lst):\n         flat_list = []\n         for item in lst:\n             if isinstance(item, list):\n                 flat_list.extend(deep_flatten(item))\n             else:\n                 flat_list.append(item)\n         return flat_list\n     ```\n\n2. **Merge k Sorted Lists**: You are given an array of k linked-lists lists, each linked-list is sorted in ascending order. Merge all the linked-lists into one sorted linked-list and return it.\n   - Solution: Use a divide and conquer approach, similar to the merge sort algorithm.

For example, if we rotate the array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` to the right by 2 positions, the result will be `[4, 5, 1, 2, 3]`.\n\nThere are several ways to perform array rotations:\n1. Brute Force: Rotate the array one element at a time, repeating the process for the number of rotations required. This is not efficient for a large number of rotations.\n2. Using Extra Space: Use an additional array to place the rotated elements in their correct positions, then copy them back to the original array.\n3. Reversal Algorithm: This is an efficient way to rotate arrays without using extra space. The idea is to reverse parts of the array to achieve the desired rotation.\n\nFor the given problem, we can use the reversal algorithm in reverse. Instead of rotating the array, we can reverse the rotations to find the original position of the element at the given index. This involves the following steps:\n- Reverse the effect of each rotation on the index by updating the index to where it would have been before the rotation.\n- After processing all rotations, return the element at the updated index.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Rotate Array**: Given an array, rotate the array to the right by `k` steps, where `k` is non-negative.\n   Solution: This can be solved using the reversal algorithm.

Append matching strings to a new list.\n\n   ```python\n   def filter_strings(strings):\n       return [s for s in strings if 'abc' in s]\n   ```\n\n2. **Finding the longest word starting with a certain letter**: Given a list of words, write a function that finds the longest word that starts with a given letter.\n\n   Solution: Iterate through the list, check if each word starts with the given letter using `startswith()`, and keep track of the longest word found.\n\n   ```python\n   def longest_word_with_letter(words, letter):\n       longest = ''\n       for word in words:\n           if word.startswith(letter) and len(word) > len(longest):\n               longest = word\n       return longest\n   ```\n\n3. **Counting words with a specific initial letter**: Given a list of words, write a function that returns the count of words that start with a specific letter.\n\n   Solution: Iterate through the list, use `startswith()` to check the initial letter, and increment a counter when a match is found.\n\n   ```python\n   def count_words_starting_with(words, letter):\n       count = 0\n       for word in words:\n           if word.startswith(letter):\n               count += 1\n       return count\n   ```\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\nWe will iterate over the list of words and use the `startswith()` method to check if each word starts with 'p'. We'll keep track of the first two words that meet this condition and return them in a tuple.\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List, Tuple\n\ndef start_withp(words: List[str]) -> Tuple[str, str]:\n    # Initialize an empty list to store the words starting with 'p'\n    p_words = []\n    \n    # Iterate over the list of words\n    for word in words:\n        # Check if the word starts with 'p'\n        if word.startswith('p'):\n            # Add the word to the list of p_words\n            p_words.append(word)\n            # If we have found two words, we can stop the search\n            if len(p_words) == 2:\n                break\n    \n    # If we have found two words, return them as a tuple\n    if len(p_words) == 2:\n        return (p_words[0], p_words[1])\n    else:\n        # If not enough words are found, return a tuple with empty strings\n        return (\"\", \"\")\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(start_withp([\"apple\", \"pear\", \"banana\", \"peach\", \"plum\"]))  # Output: ('pear', 'peach')\n```\n\nThis code will correctly identify the first two words in the list that start with 'p' and return them in a tuple. If there are fewer than two words that start with 'p', it will return a tuple with empty strings to indicate that not enough words were found."], "prompt_tokens": [213], "completion_tokens": [909], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": false, "task_id": "mbpp_305_start_withp"}

The idea is to find a subsequence of the given list where the elements are in sorted order, and the sum of the elements is maximized. The twist in this problem is that we must include a specific element `k` in the subsequence.\n\n## Tutorial:\nDynamic programming is a method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems. It is applicable when the problem can be divided into overlapping subproblems that can be solved independently.\n\nFor the Longest Increasing Subsequence problem, a typical dynamic programming solution involves creating an array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending with the `i`-th element. To solve for `dp[i]`, we look at all elements before `i` and find the one that provides the longest increasing subsequence when `a[i]` is appended to it.\n\nTo adapt this for the maximum sum increasing subsequence, we modify the `dp` array to store the maximum sum instead of the length. For each element `a[i]`, we look at all previous elements `a[j]` where `j < i` and `a[j] < a[i]`, and we update `dp[i]` to be the maximum of `dp[i]` and `dp[j] + a[i]`.\n\nSince we need to include a specific element `k` in the subsequence, we must ensure that our subsequence includes `a[k]`. We can do this by running our dynamic programming algorithm up to index `k`, and then taking the maximum sum subsequence that ends before `k` and adding `a[k]` to it.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS)**: Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest increasing subsequence.\n   Solution: Use dynamic programming to maintain an array `dp` where `dp[i]` is the length of the LIS ending at `i`. For each `i`, iterate through all `j < i` and if `a[j] < a[i]`, update `dp[i]` to `max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)`.\n\n2. **Maximum Sum Increasing Subsequence (MSIS)**: Similar to LIS, but instead of the length, find the maximum sum of an increasing subsequence.\n   Solution: Use dynamic programming with an array `dp` where `dp[i]` is the maximum sum of the increasing subsequence ending at `i`. For each `i`, iterate through all `j < i` and if `a[j] < a[i]`, update `dp[i]` to `max(dp[i], dp[j] + a[i])`.\n\n3. **Weighted Job Scheduling**: Given jobs with start times, end times, and profits, find the maximum profit such that no two jobs overlap.\n   Solution: Sort the jobs by end time, then use dynamic programming to maintain an array `dp` where `dp[i]` is the maximum profit up to the `i`-th job. For each job `i`, find the last job `j` that doesn't conflict with `i` and update `dp[i]` to `max(dp[i], dp[j] + profit[i])`.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef max_sum_increasing_subseq(a: List[int], n: int, index: int, k: int) -> int:\n    # Initialize the dp array with the value of the elements\n    dp = a.copy()\n    \n    # Build the dp array for the maximum sum increasing subsequence\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        for j in range(i):\n            if a[j] < a[i]:\n                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + a[i])\n    \n    # Include the kth element in the subsequence\n    max_sum_with_k = a[k]\n    for i in range(index):\n        if a[i] < a[k]:\n            max_sum_with_k = max(max_sum_with_k, dp[i] + a[k])\n    \n    return max_sum_with_k\n\n# Example usage:\na = [1, 101, 2, 3, 100, 4, 5]\nn = len(a)\nindex = 3\nk = 4\nprint(max_sum_increasing_subseq(a, n, index, k))  # Output should be 106\n```\n\nExplanation of the solution:\nThe function `max_sum_increasing_subseq` calculates the maximum sum of an increasing subsequence that includes the `k`-th element and ends at or before the `index`-th element. It uses dynamic programming to build up a `dp` array that stores the maximum sum increasing subsequence ending at each index. After populating the `dp` array, it iterates up to the `index` to find the maximum sum that can be achieved by including the `k`-th element."], "prompt_tokens": [242], "completion_tokens": [1060], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": false, "task_id": "mbpp_306_max_sum_increasing_subseq"}

Generate all possible products by multiplying each element from `nums1` with each element from `nums2`.\n2. Use a min-heap to maintain the N largest products.\n3. Return the N largest products from the min-heap.\n\n## Tutorial:\nA min-heap is a binary tree where the value of each node is less than or equal to the values of its children. The root, therefore, is the minimum element in the tree. In Python, the `heapq` module provides functions for implementing heaps based on regular lists.\n\nHere's how you can use a min-heap in Python to find the N largest elements in a collection:\n\n1. Import the `heapq` module.\n2. Use `heapq.heappush()` to push elements onto the heap.\n3. Use `heapq.heappop()` to pop the smallest element from the heap.\n4. To maintain the N largest elements, push new elements onto the heap, and if the heap size exceeds N, pop the smallest element.\n\nThis ensures that you always have the N largest elements in the heap.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Kth Largest Element in an Array**: Find the kth largest element in an unsorted array. This problem can be solved by maintaining a min-heap of size k. Iterate through the array, pushing elements onto the heap, and if the heap size exceeds k, pop the smallest element. The kth largest element will be at the root of the heap.\n\n2. **Merge k Sorted Lists**: Merge k sorted linked lists into one sorted linked list. You can use a min-heap to efficiently find the next smallest element among the heads of the k lists. Push the initial heads of all lists onto the heap, then repeatedly pop the smallest element and push the next element from the same list until all lists are exhausted.\n\n3. **Find Median from Data Stream**: Maintain two heaps, a max-heap for the lower half of the numbers and a min-heap for the upper half. Add numbers to the appropriate heap and balance the heaps so that the max-heap always has the same number or one more element than the min-heap.

The most common comparison operators are:\n\n- `==` (equal to)\n- `!=` (not equal to)\n- `>` (greater than)\n- `<` (less than)\n- `>=` (greater than or equal to)\n- `<=` (less than or equal to)\n\nTo find the maximum of two numbers, you can use the `>` (greater than) or `>=` (greater than or equal to) operator. The basic logic is to compare the two numbers and return the one that is greater.\n\nHere's a simple step-by-step process:\n1. Compare the first number (`a`) with the second number (`b`).\n2. If `a` is greater than `b`, then `a` is the maximum.\n3.

To convert a string into a list of characters, you can use a simple for-loop or a list comprehension.\n\nHere's a brief tutorial on both methods:\n\n### Using a for-loop:\n```python\ndef string_to_tuple(str1):\n    result = []\n    for char in str1:\n        result.append(char)\n    return result\n```\nIn this method, you create an empty list called `result`.

In binary, a power of 2 is represented as a `1` followed by zeros. For example, `2^3` (or 8 in decimal) is `1000` in binary. To find the highest power of 2 less than or equal to `n`, we need to find the most significant bit that is set to `1` in the binary representation of `n`.\n\nOne algorithm to solve this problem is to use bitwise operations. Specifically, we can use the left shift operator (`<<`) to multiply by 2, and the right shift operator (`>>`) to divide by 2, checking at each step if the result is still less than or equal to `n`.\n\n## Tutorial:\nBitwise operations are a fundamental concept in computer science and are used for manipulating individual bits within an integer. Here are some common bitwise operations:\n\n- `&` (bitwise AND): Takes two bit patterns of equal length and performs the logical AND operation on each pair of corresponding bits.\n- `|` (bitwise OR): Takes two bit patterns of equal length and performs the logical inclusive OR operation on each pair of corresponding bits.\n- `^` (bitwise XOR): Takes two bit patterns of equal length and performs the logical exclusive OR operation on each pair of corresponding bits.\n- `~` (bitwise NOT): Inverts all the bits in the bit pattern.\n- `<<` (left shift): Shifts all the bits in the bit pattern to the left by a certain number of specified bits.\n- `>>` (right shift): Shifts all the bits in the bit pattern to the right by a certain number of specified bits.\n\nFor the problem at hand, we can start with the number 1 (which is `2^0`) and keep shifting it to the left until shifting it again would result in a number greater than `n`. The last number before the shift that would exceed `n` is the highest power of 2 less than or equal to `n`.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Counting Bits**: Given a non-negative integer `num`, return the number of steps to reduce it to zero. In one step, if the current number is even, you have to divide it by 2, otherwise, you have to subtract 1 from it.\n   - Solution: Use bitwise operations to check if the number is even (using `num & 1`) and apply the corresponding operation.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def numberOfSteps(num: int) -> int:\n         steps = 0\n         while num > 0:\n             if num & 1:\n                 num -= 1\n             else:\n                 num >>= 1\n             steps += 1\n         return steps\n     ```\n\n2. **Power of Two**: Given an integer, write a function to determine if it is a power of two.\n   - Solution: A number is a power of two if it has exactly one bit set to `1`. We can use `n & (n - 1)` to check if `n` has more than one bit set.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def isPowerOfTwo(n: int) -> bool:\n         if n <= 0:\n             return False\n         return n & (n - 1) == 0\n     ```\n\n3. **Reverse Bits**: Reverse bits of a given 32 bits unsigned integer.\n   - Solution: Iterate through each bit of the number and construct the reverse bit by bit using bitwise shift and OR operations.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def reverseBits(n: int) -> int:\n         rev = 0\n         for i in range(32):\n             rev = (rev << 1) | (n & 1)\n             n >>= 1\n         return rev\n     ```\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n- Explanation of the solution:\n  To find the highest power of 2 less than or equal to `n`, we can initialize a variable `res` with 1 and keep shifting it to the left until it is greater than `n`. Then, we return the result of shifting `res` back to the right by one position.\n\n- Python3 code to solve the problem:\n  ```python\n  def highest_Power_of_2(n: int) -> int:\n      res = 1\n      while res <= n:\n          res <<= 1\n      return res >> 1\n  \n  # Example usage:\n  print(highest_Power_of_2(23))  # Output: 16\n  print(highest_Power_of_2(64))  # Output: 64\n  ```\nThis code will correctly find the highest power of 2 less than or equal to the given number `n`."], "prompt_tokens": [208], "completion_tokens": [1030], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": false, "task_id": "mbpp_388_highest_Power_of_2"}

The core concept here is similar to the Fibonacci sequence, where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, except the Lucas sequence starts with 2 and 1 instead of 0 and 1.\n\n## Tutorial:\nDynamic Programming (DP) is a method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems. It is applicable when the problem can be divided into overlapping subproblems that can be solved independently. The key idea is to store the solutions to these subproblems in a table (usually an array or a dictionary) so that when the same subproblem occurs, instead of recomputing its solution, one can simply look up the previously computed solution, thereby saving computation time. This technique is known as memoization.\n\nFor the Lucas numbers, the recursive formula is:\n```\nL(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2)\n```\nwith base cases:\n```\nL(0) = 2\nL(1) = 1\n```\nTo implement this using Dynamic Programming, we can either use a bottom-up approach, where we iteratively compute Lucas numbers starting from the base cases, or a top-down approach, where we use recursion and memoization to compute the Lucas numbers on demand.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Fibonacci Sequence**: Given `n`, calculate the n'th Fibonacci number. The Fibonacci sequence is defined as `F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)` with base cases `F(0) = 0` and `F(1) = 1`. This problem can be solved using the same DP techniques as the Lucas numbers.\n\n2. **Climbing Stairs**: You are climbing a staircase. It takes `n` steps to reach the top. Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top? This problem is similar to the Fibonacci sequence, where the number of ways to reach step `n` is the sum of the ways to reach step `n-1` and step `n-2`.\n\n3. **Coin Change**: Given an unlimited supply of coins of given denominations and a total amount of money `amount`, compute the number of ways to make up that amount. This problem can be solved using DP by building up a table `ways` where `ways[i]` represents the number of ways to make up amount `i` using the given coin denominations.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n- Explanation of the solution:\nWe will use a bottom-up Dynamic Programming approach to solve the problem. We will create an array `lucas` where `lucas[i]` will store the i'th Lucas number. We will start by initializing the first two numbers of the sequence, and then iteratively compute the rest of the Lucas numbers up to `n`.\n\n- Python3 code to solve the problem:\n```python\ndef find_lucas(n: int) -> int:\n    if n == 0:\n        return 2\n    elif n == 1:\n        return 1\n    \n    lucas = [0] * (n+1)\n    lucas[0], lucas[1] = 2, 1\n    \n    for i in range(2, n+1):\n        lucas[i] = lucas[i-1] + lucas[i-2]\n    \n    return lucas[n]\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(find_lucas(5))  # Output: 11\n```\n\nThis code will efficiently compute the n'th Lucas number in O(n) time and O(n) space complexity. If space optimization is needed, we can use only two variables to store the last two Lucas numbers since we only need the last two values at any step to compute the next Lucas number."], "prompt_tokens": [197], "completion_tokens": [815], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": true, "task_id": "mbpp_389_find_lucas"}

String formatting in Python involves creating a string that contains placeholders, which are then replaced by values. Python provides multiple ways to format strings, including the old-style `%` formatting, the `str.format()` method, and f-strings (formatted string literals) introduced in Python 3.6.\n\n## Tutorial:\nString formatting is a common task in programming where you need to construct a string with dynamic content. Here's a brief overview of the three main methods of string formatting in Python:\n\n1. **% Operator (Old-style Formatting):**\n   This is the original method of string formatting in Python. Placeholders are represented by `%` followed by a single character that specifies the data type (e.g., `%s` for strings, `%d` for integers).\n\n   ```python\n   name = \"Alice\"\n   greeting = \"Hello, %s!\" % name\n   print(greeting)  # Output: Hello, Alice!\n   ```\n\n2. **str.format() Method:**\n   Introduced in Python 2.6, this method uses curly braces `{}` as placeholders which can be either empty or contain a number or keyword to specify the order or source of the data.\n\n   ```python\n   name = \"Bob\"\n   greeting = \"Hello, {}!\".format(name)\n   print(greeting)  # Output: Hello, Bob!\n   ```\n\n3. **f-Strings (Formatted String Literals):**\n   Available from Python 3.6 onwards, f-strings are a more readable and concise way to format strings. Prefix the string with `f` and use curly braces with expressions inside.\n\n   ```python\n   name = \"Charlie\"\n   greeting = f\"Hello, {name}!\"\n   print(greeting)  # Output: Hello, Charlie!\n   ```\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **String Interpolation:**\n   Given a template string with placeholders and a dictionary of values, replace the placeholders with the corresponding values from the dictionary.\n\n   Solution: Use the `str.format()` method with keyword arguments unpacked from the dictionary.\n\n   ```python\n   template = \"My name is {name} and I am {age} years old.\"\n   values = {'name': 'John', 'age': 30}\n   formatted_string = template.format(**values)\n   print(formatted_string)  # Output: My name is John and I am 30 years old.\n   ```\n\n2. **Generating HTML Tags:**\n   Write a function that takes a tag name and content and returns a string with the HTML tag wrapping the content.\n\n   Solution: Use f-strings to dynamically create the HTML string.\n\n   ```python\n   def generate_html(tag, content):\n       return f\"<{tag}>{content}</{tag}>\"\n   html_str = generate_html('p', 'This is a paragraph.')\n   print(html_str)  # Output: <p>This is a paragraph.</p>\n   ```\n\n3. **Log File Formatting:**\n   Given a list of log messages and a format string, write a function to prepend the current date and time to each log message.\n\n   Solution: Use the `datetime` module to get the current time and f-strings to format the log messages.\n\n   ```python\n   from datetime import datetime\n   log_messages = [\"Error occurred\", \"User logged in\"]\n   formatted_logs = [f\"{datetime.now()}: {message}\" for message in log_messages]\n   for log in formatted_logs:\n       print(log)\n   ```\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\nThe function `add_string` takes a list of elements and a format string. It applies the format string to each element in the list, treating each element as a string, and returns a new list with the formatted strings.\n\nPython3 code to solve the problem:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List, Any\n\ndef add_string(list_: List[Any], string: str) -> List[str]:\n    # Use a list comprehension to apply the format string to each element\n    return [string.format(item) for item in list_]\n\n# Example usage:\nelements = [1, 2, 3]\nformat_string = \"Number: {}\"\nformatted_elements = add_string(elements, format_string)\nprint(formatted_elements)  # Output: ['Number: 1', 'Number: 2', 'Number: 3']\n```\n\nIn this code, we use the `str.format()` method to apply the format string to each element in the list.

The task is to merge multiple lists into a single list of nested dictionaries. This requires iterating over the lists and combining their elements into the desired structure.\n\n## Tutorial:\nIn Python, a dictionary is a collection of key-value pairs, where each key is unique. A nested dictionary is a dictionary that contains another dictionary as a value for some of its keys. To create a nested dictionary from lists, you can use a loop to iterate over the elements of the lists and construct the dictionary structure as required.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide to solving the problem:\n\n1. Initialize an empty list that will store the resulting nested dictionaries.\n2. Iterate over the elements of the lists using a loop. You can use the `zip` function if the lists are of the same length to iterate over them in parallel.\n3. For each iteration, create a new dictionary with the desired structure using the elements from the lists.\n4. Append the newly created dictionary to the result list.\n5. Return the result list after the loop ends.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Merging Two Dictionaries**: Given two dictionaries, merge them into a single dictionary. The solution involves iterating over the keys and values of both dictionaries and combining them appropriately.\n\n2. **Grouping Anagrams**: Given a list of strings, group anagrams together. You can use a dictionary to map sorted strings to lists of anagrams.\n\n3. **Building a Tree from a List of Edges**: Given a list of edges that represent a tree, build a nested dictionary that represents the tree structure. Each node in the tree is a key in the dictionary, and its children are represented as a dictionary in the value.\n\nFor each of these problems, the solution would involve understanding and manipulating dictionaries, possibly creating nested structures, and iterating over lists.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\nThe function `convert_list_dictionary` takes three lists as input.

If you see that the problem has been solved already, you simply return the cached result. If it hasn't been solved, you solve it and store the result. This is usually implemented with recursion and a data structure (like a dictionary) to store the results for each subproblem.\n\n2. **Bottom-Up Approach (Tabulation):**\n   In this approach, you solve all the subproblems first and use their solutions to build up solutions to bigger problems. This is typically done using iterative methods and starts with the smallest subproblems, gradually solving larger and larger ones.\n\nBoth methods have their use cases, but for problems with a large number of subproblems or deep recursion trees, bottom-up can be more efficient as it avoids the overhead of recursive calls.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Fibonacci Sequence:**\n   Problem: Given `n`, calculate the `n`th Fibonacci number.\n   Solution: Use DP to store the Fibonacci numbers as you calculate them to avoid redundant calculations.\n   ```python\n   def fibonacci(n):\n       if n <= 1:\n           return n\n       fib = [0] * (n+1)\n       fib[1] = 1\n       for i in range(2, n+1):\n           fib[i] = fib[i-1] + fib[i-2]\n       return fib[n]\n   ```\n\n2. **Coin Change Problem:**\n   Problem: Given an unlimited supply of coins of given denominations, find the total number of ways to make a change of size `n`.\n   Solution: Use DP to build up the solution from smaller to larger amounts.\n   ```python\n   def coin_change(coins, amount):\n       dp = [0] * (amount + 1)\n       dp[0] = 1\n       for coin in coins:\n           for x in range(coin, amount + 1):\n               dp[x] += dp[x - coin]\n       return dp[amount]\n   ```\n\n3. **0/1 Knapsack Problem:**\n   Problem: Given weights and values of `n` items, put these items in a knapsack of capacity `W` to get the maximum total value in the knapsack.\n   Solution: Use DP to consider all subsets of items and calculate the maximum value for each subset considering the weight constraints.\n   ```python\n   def knapsack(W, wt, val, n):\n       K = [[0 for x in range(W + 1)] for x in range(n + 1)]\n       for i in range(n + 1):\n           for w in range(W + 1):\n               if i == 0 or w == 0:\n                   K[i][w] = 0\n               elif wt[i-1] <= w:\n                   K[i][w] = max(val[i-1] + K[i-1][w-wt[i-1]], K[i-1][w])\n               else:\n                   K[i][w] = K[i-1][w]\n       return K[n][W]\n   ```\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\nThe given problem can be solved using a top-down dynamic programming approach with memoization. We will create a memoization dictionary to store the results of subproblems. For each call to `f(n)`, we will check if the result is already in the memoization dictionary. If it is, we return that result. Otherwise, we compute the result using the given equation and store it in the dictionary.\n\n```python\ndef get_max_sum(n: int, memo=None) -> int:\n    if memo is None:\n        memo = {}\n    if n in memo:\n        return memo[n]\n    if n == 0:\n        return 0\n    # Compute the maximum sum using the given equation\n    memo[n] = max(get_max_sum(n//2, memo) + get_max_sum(n//3, memo) + get_max_sum(n//4, memo) + get_max_sum(n//5, memo), n)\n    return memo[n]\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(get_max_sum(10))  # Output will be the maximum sum for f(10)\n```\n\nThis code will efficiently compute the maximum sum for any given `n` by avoiding redundant calculations of the subproblems."], "prompt_tokens": [230], "completion_tokens": [1012], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": true, "task_id": "mbpp_392_get_max_sum"}

The task is to iterate through the list of lists and find the one with the maximum length.

It sequentially checks each element of the list for the target value until a match is found or until all the elements have been searched. In the context of this problem, instead of searching for a specific value, we are interested in finding the list with the maximum length.\n\nHere's how you can perform a linear search to find the maximum length list:\n1. Initialize a variable to keep track of the maximum length found so far, and another variable to store the list with the maximum length.\n2. Iterate through each list in the list of lists.\n3. For each list, check if its length is greater than the maximum length found so far.\n4. If it is, update the maximum length and the list with the maximum length.\n5. After the iteration, return the maximum length and the list with the maximum length.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Finding the Longest Word in a Sentence**: Given a sentence, find the longest word in it. The solution involves splitting the sentence into words and using a linear search to find the word with the maximum length.\n\n2. **Maximum Subarray Sum (Kadane's Algorithm)**: Given an integer array, find the contiguous subarray which has the largest sum. This problem is a bit more complex and involves dynamic programming, but at its core, it uses a linear search to find the maximum sum by iterating through the array.\n\n3. **Largest Number in a List**: Given a list of numbers, find the largest number. This is a simple linear search problem where you iterate through the list and keep track of the maximum number found so far.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\nThe solution involves initializing two variables, one to keep track of the maximum length (`max_len`) and another to store the list with the maximum length (`max_list`). We then iterate through each list in `input_list` and update `max_len` and `max_list` accordingly. Finally, we return a tuple containing `max_len` and `max_list`.\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List, Tuple\n\ndef max_length_list(input_list: List[List[int]]) -> Tuple[int, List[int]]:\n    max_len = 0\n    max_list = []\n    \n    for lst in input_list:\n        if len(lst) > max_len:\n            max_len = len(lst)\n            max_list = lst\n            \n    return max_len, max_list\n\n# Example usage:\ninput_list = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5], [6, 7, 8, 9]]\nprint(max_length_list(input_list))  # Output will be (4, [6, 7, 8, 9])\n```\n\nThis code will correctly identify the list with the maximum length from the given list of lists."], "prompt_tokens": [209], "completion_tokens": [638], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": true, "task_id": "mbpp_393_max_length_list"}

The two main algorithms or methods that can be used here are:\n\n1. **Hashing (using a set)**: A set in Python is an unordered collection of items where every element is unique (no duplicates). We can iterate through the list and add each element to a set. If at any point the size of the set does not increase after adding an element, it means the element is a duplicate.\n\n2. **Sorting**: By sorting the list, any duplicates will be adjacent to each other. We can then iterate through the sorted list and check if any two consecutive elements are the same.\n\n## Tutorial:\n### Hashing with Sets:\nA set is a collection which is unordered and unindexed. In Python, sets are written with curly brackets. One of the main advantages of using a set is that it stores unique elements, and adding an existing element to a set does not change the set. This property can be used to check for duplicates by iterating over the list and adding each element to the set. If the size of the set does not increase after adding an element, it indicates that the element is a duplicate.\n\nHere's a simple example of using a set to check for duplicates:\n\n```python\ndef has_duplicates(lst):\n    seen = set()\n    for element in lst:\n        if element in seen:\n            return True\n        seen.add(element)\n    return False\n```\n\n### Sorting:\nSorting is another method to check for duplicates. After sorting the list, all duplicates will be positioned next to each other. By iterating through the sorted list and checking if any two consecutive elements are the same, we can determine if there are duplicates.\n\nHere's an example of using sorting to check for duplicates:\n\n```python\ndef has_duplicates(lst):\n    lst.sort()\n    for i in range(1, len(lst)):\n        if lst[i] == lst[i-1]:\n            return True\n    return False\n```\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Finding Duplicate in an Array**: Given an array of integers where each element appears twice except for one, find that single one. The solution involves using a set or XOR operation to identify the unique element.\n\n2. **Valid Sudoku**: Determine if a 9x9 Sudoku board is valid. Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the following rules: Each row must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition, each column must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition, and each of the 9 3x3 sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition. This problem can be solved by using sets to check for duplicates in rows, columns, and sub-boxes.\n\n3. **Contains Duplicate II**: Given an array of integers and an integer k, find out whether there are two distinct indices i and j in the array such that nums[i] = nums[j] and the absolute difference between i and j is at most k. This problem can be solved by using a sliding window approach with a set to keep track of the elements in the current window.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\nWe will use a set to solve this problem. We will iterate through the list and add each element to the set.

In Python, strings are sequences of characters, and they are immutable, meaning that once a string is created, it cannot be changed.\n\nTo access characters in a string, you can use indexing. In Python, indexing starts at 0, so the first character of a string is at index 0, and the last character is at index -1. For example, in the string `s = \"hello\"`, `s[0]` would be `'h'`, and `s[-1]` would be `'o'`.\n\nTo compare two characters, you can use the equality operator `==`. If the characters are the same, the operator will return `True`; otherwise, it will return `False`.\n\nHere's a quick example of how you can access and compare the first and last characters of a string:\n\n```python\ns = \"racecar\"\nfirst_char = s[0]\nlast_char = s[-1]\nare_same = first_char == last_char\nprint(are_same)  # Output: True\n```\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Palindrome Check**: Given a string, determine if it is a palindrome (reads the same backward as forward).

The median will be the element at index 1 (since list indices start at 0).\n\nSorting is a fundamental concept in computer science and is used in a wide range of problems. The simplest sorting algorithm is the bubble sort, but more efficient algorithms like quicksort, mergesort, and heapsort are commonly used.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Finding the k-th largest element in an array**: Given an unsorted array and a number k, find the k-th largest element in the array.\n   - Solution: You can sort the array and then access the k-th largest element directly, or you can use a selection algorithm like QuickSelect to find the element without fully sorting the array.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def find_kth_largest(nums, k):\n         nums.sort(reverse=True)\n         return nums[k-1]\n     ```\n\n2. **Closest numbers**: Given a list of numbers, find the pair of numbers with the smallest absolute difference.\n   - Solution: Sort the list and then iterate through the sorted list to find the pair with the smallest difference.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def closest_numbers(arr):\n         arr.sort()\n         min_diff = float('inf')\n         closest_pair = []\n         for i in range(len(arr) - 1):\n             diff = arr[i+1] - arr[i]\n             if diff < min_diff:\n                 min_diff = diff\n                 closest_pair = [(arr[i], arr[i+1])]\n             elif diff == min_diff:\n                 closest_pair.append((arr[i], arr[i+1]))\n         return closest_pair\n     ```\n\n3. **Majority Element**: Given an array of size n, find the element that appears more than n/2 times.\n   - Solution: This can be solved using the Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm, which is a constant space, linear time algorithm.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def majority_element(nums):\n         count = 0\n         candidate = None\n         for num in nums:\n             if count == 0:\n                 candidate = num\n             count += (1 if num == candidate else -1)\n         return candidate\n     ```\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n- Explanation of the solution:\n  To find the median of three numbers, we can simply compare the numbers and find the one that is not the largest or the smallest. This can be done with a few conditional checks.\n\n- Python3 code to solve the problem:\n  ```python\n  def median_numbers(a: int, b: int, c: int) -> float:\n      \"\"\"\n      Write a function to find the median of three numbers.\n      \"\"\"\n      # If a is the middle value\n      if (a >= b and a <= c) or (a >= c and a <= b):\n          return a\n      # If b is the middle value\n      elif (b >= a and b <= c) or (b >= c and b <= a):\n          return b\n      # If c is the middle value\n      else:\n          return c\n\n  # Example usage:\n  print(median_numbers(1, 2, 3))  # Output: 2\n  print(median_numbers(4, 1, 3))  # Output: 3\n  print(median_numbers(10, 20, 15))  # Output: 15\n  ```\nThis function will correctly return the median of the three input numbers."], "prompt_tokens": [202], "completion_tokens": [873], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": false, "task_id": "mbpp_397_median_numbers"}

This operation takes two bits and returns 1 if the bits are different, and 0 if they are the same. When applied to integers, the XOR operation is performed on each pair of corresponding bits in the binary representations of the numbers.\n\n## Tutorial:\nThe bitwise XOR operation is denoted by the caret symbol `^` in Python. Here's how it works on individual bits:\n\n```\n0 ^ 0 = 0\n0 ^ 1 = 1\n1 ^ 0 = 1\n1 ^ 1 = 0\n```\n\nWhen applied to integers, the XOR operation is performed bit by bit, starting from the least significant bit (rightmost bit) to the most significant bit (leftmost bit). For example:\n\n```\n  1010 (decimal 10)\n^ 1100 (decimal 12)\n------\n  0110 (decimal 6)\n```\n\nThe XOR operation has several properties that are useful in competitive programming:\n\n1. `x ^ x = 0` for any integer `x`.\n2. `x ^ 0 = x` for any integer `x`.\n3. XOR is associative: `(x ^ y) ^ z = x ^ (y ^ z)`.\n4. XOR is commutative: `x ^ y = y ^ x`.\n\nThese properties can be used to solve various problems, such as finding the unique element in an array where all other elements appear twice, or encrypting data by XORing it with a key.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Finding the Unique Element**: Given an array where every element appears twice except for one, find the unique element. The solution is to XOR all the elements together. Due to the XOR properties, all the duplicates will cancel out, leaving only the unique element.\n\n2. **Flipping Bits**: Given an integer, flip all the bits (change 0 to 1 and 1 to 0) and return the result. The solution is to XOR the number with a bitmask that has all bits set to 1 (e.g., `0b11111111` for an 8-bit number).\n\n3. **Swap Two Numbers Without Temporary Variable**: Given two integers, swap them without using a temporary variable. The solution is to use XOR operations to hold the difference between the two numbers and then reconstruct the original numbers from the difference.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\nThe solution involves applying the XOR operation to each corresponding pair of elements from the two tuples.

Sets are mutable and can be used to perform mathematical set operations like union, intersection, difference, and symmetric difference.\n\nHere's how you can use a set in Python:\n- To create a set, you can use curly braces `{}` or the `set()` function.\n- To add an element to a set, use the `.add()` method.\n- To remove an element, use the `.remove()` or `.discard()` method. The difference is that `.remove()` will raise a KeyError if the element is not present, while `.discard()` will not.\n- To check if an element is in a set, you can use the `in` keyword.\n- To get the number of elements in a set, use the `len()` function.\n\nSets are particularly useful when you need to keep track of unique items, as they automatically handle duplicates for you.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Distinct Numbers**: Given a list of numbers, count how many distinct numbers there are.\n   - Solution: Use a set to store each number.

The comparison operation checks which of the two numbers is smaller and returns that number.\n\n## Tutorial:\nIn programming, comparison operations are used to evaluate the relationship between two values. The basic comparison operators are:\n\n- `==` (equal to)\n- `!=` (not equal to)\n- `<` (less than)\n- `>` (greater than)\n- `<=` (less than or equal to)\n- `>=` (greater than or equal to)\n\nTo find the minimum of two numbers, we use the less than (`<`) operator to compare the two numbers. If the first number is less than the second number, it is the minimum; otherwise, the second number is the minimum.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide to finding the minimum of two numbers:\n\n1. Take two numbers as input.\n2. Compare the first number with the second number using the `<` operator.\n3. If the first number is less than the second number, return the first number.\n4. Otherwise, return the second number.\n\nThis logic can be implemented in a single line of code using the `min` function in Python, which is built-in and does exactly this comparison for you.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Finding the Minimum in a List**: Given a list of integers, find the minimum value.\n   - Solution: Iterate through the list, comparing each element to the current minimum. Update the minimum when a smaller element is found.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def find_minimum_in_list(lst):\n         return min(lst)\n     ```\n\n2. **Closest to Zero**: Given a list of integers, find the number closest to zero.\n   - Solution: Iterate through the list, keeping track of the number with the smallest absolute value.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def closest_to_zero(lst):\n         return min(lst, key=abs)\n     ```\n\n3. **Minimum Difference**: Given two lists of integers, find the pair of numbers (one from each list) with the smallest absolute difference.\n   - Solution: Sort both lists and use two pointers to iterate through the lists, updating the minimum difference as you go.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def minimum_difference(list1, list2):\n         list1.sort()\n         list2.sort()\n         i = j = 0\n         min_diff = float('inf')\n         while i < len(list1) and j < len(list2):\n             diff = abs(list1[i] - list2[j])\n             if diff < min_diff:\n                 min_diff = diff\n             if list1[i] < list2[j]:\n                 i += 1\n             else:\n                 j += 1\n         return min_diff\n     ```\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n- Explanation of the solution:\n  The solution is straightforward: we compare the two numbers `a` and `b` using the `<` operator.

The task is to check for the existence of an element within a collection, which is a fundamental operation in computer science. The simplest form of search is a linear search, where each element of the collection is checked one by one until the desired element is found or the end of the collection is reached.\n\n## Tutorial:\nLinear search is an algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a list. It sequentially checks each element of the list for the target value until a match is found or until all the elements have been searched. Linear search runs in O(n) time, where n is the number of elements in the list. This means that the time taken to search through the list increases linearly with the number of elements.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide to performing a linear search:\n1. Start from the first element of the list and compare the target value with the current element.\n2. If the target value matches the current element, return the index of the element or a success indicator.\n3. If the target value does not match, move to the next element.\n4. Repeat steps 1-3 until the target is found or the end of the list is reached.\n5. If the end of the list is reached without finding the target, return an indicator of failure (such as `False` or `-1`).\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Finding the First Occurrence of an Element in a List:**\n   Problem: Given a list of elements and a target value, find the index of the first occurrence of the target in the list.\n   Solution: Use a linear search to iterate through the list and return the index of the first match.\n   Python3 code:\n   ```python\n   def find_first_occurrence(lst, target):\n       for index, value in enumerate(lst):\n           if value == target:\n               return index\n       return -1\n   ```\n\n2. **Checking for a Subset:**\n   Problem: Given two lists, check if the first list is a subset of the second list.\n   Solution: For each element in the first list, use a linear search to check if it exists in the second list.\n   Python3 code:\n   ```python\n   def is_subset(list1, list2):\n       for element in list1:\n           if element not in list2:\n               return False\n       return True\n   ```\n\n3. **Finding All Occurrences of an Element:**\n   Problem: Given a list and a target value, find all the indices where the target occurs in the list.\n   Solution: Use a linear search to iterate through the list and collect all indices where a match is found.\n   Python3 code:\n   ```python\n   def find_all_occurrences(lst, target):\n       indices = []\n       for index, value in enumerate(lst):\n           if value == target:\n               indices.append(index)\n       return indices\n   ```\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\nThe function `check_tuplex` takes a list `tuplex` that can contain elements of type `str` or `int`, and another variable `tuple1` which is the element to search for within `tuplex`. The function will perform a linear search to check if `tuple1` exists in `tuplex` and return `True` if it does, or `False` otherwise.\n\nPython3 code to solve the problem:\n```python\nfrom typing import List, Union, Any\n\ndef check_tuplex(tuplex: List[Union[str, int]], tuple1: Any) -> bool:\n    # Iterate through each element in the list\n    for element in tuplex:\n        # Check if the current element matches the one we're looking for\n        if element == tuple1:\n            return True  # Element found\n    return False  # Element not found after checking all elements\n\n# Example usage:\n# print(check_tuplex([1, \"hello\", 3, \"world\"], \"hello\"))  # Output: True\n# print(check_tuplex([1, \"hello\", 3, \"world\"], 5))        # Output: False\n```\nThe function iterates over each element in the list `tuplex` and compares it with `tuple1`.

Specifically, we can use bitwise operations to count the number of set bits (bits that are 1) in the binary representation of the number. The parity is odd if the count of set bits is odd, and even if the count is even.\n\n## Tutorial:\nBit manipulation involves using bitwise operators to directly manipulate individual bits of binary numbers. The most common bitwise operators are AND (`&`), OR (`|`), XOR (`^`), NOT (`~`), and bit shifts (`<<` and `>>`).\n\nTo find the parity of a number, we can use the XOR operator, which returns 1 if the number of 1s is odd and 0 if even. We can iterate through each bit of the number, XORing a counter with the current bit. Alternatively, we can use a more efficient approach that repeatedly XORs the number with itself shifted right by decreasing powers of two. This reduces the number of operations required.\n\nHere's a simple algorithm to find the parity of a number:\n1. Initialize a variable `result` to 0.\n2. Loop through each bit of the number:\n   a. XOR `result` with the current bit of the number.\n3. If `result` is 1 at the end, the parity is odd; otherwise, it's even.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Counting Bits**: Given a non-negative integer `num`, return the number of 1s in the binary representation of every number between 0 and `num` inclusive.\n   - Solution: Iterate from 0 to `num`, and for each number, use bit manipulation to count the number of 1s.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def countBits(num: int) -> List[int]:\n         result = []\n         for i in range(num + 1):\n             result.append(bin(i).count('1'))\n         return result\n     ```\n\n2. **Single Number**: Given a non-empty array of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.\n   - Solution: Use the XOR operator to XOR all the elements. The result will be the single number as XORing two identical numbers cancels them out.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def singleNumber(nums: List[int]) -> int:\n         result = 0\n         for num in nums:\n             result ^= num\n         return result\n     ```\n\n3. **Power of Two**: Given an integer, write a function to determine if it is a power of two.\n   - Solution: A number is a power of two if it has exactly one bit set. We can check this by turning off the rightmost 1-bit and checking if the result is 0.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def isPowerOfTwo(n: int) -> bool:\n         if n <= 0:\n             return False\n         return n & (n - 1) == 0\n     ```\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n- Explanation of the solution:\n  To solve the original problem, we can use the XOR approach to count the number of set bits.

We can use two heaps (a max-heap for the lower half and a min-heap for the upper half) to maintain the elements in a way that allows us to efficiently find the median.\n\n3. **Top K Frequent Elements**: Given a non-empty array of integers, return the k most frequent elements. We can use a heap to maintain the top k elements based on their frequency.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n```python\nfrom typing import List\nimport heapq\n\ndef k_smallest_pairs(nums1: List[int], nums2: List[int], k: int) -> List[List[int]]:\n    if not nums1 or not nums2 or k <= 0:\n        return []\n\n    min_heap = []\n    # Initialize the heap with pairs (sum, index1, index2)\n    for i in range(min(k, len(nums1))):\n        heapq.heappush(min_heap, (nums1[i] + nums2[0], i, 0))\n\n    result = []\n    # Extract the k smallest pairs\n    while k > 0 and min_heap:\n        _, i, j = heapq.heappop(min_heap)\n        result.append([nums1[i], nums2[j]])\n        if j + 1 < len(nums2):\n            heapq.heappush(min_heap, (nums1[i] + nums2[j + 1], i, j + 1))\n        k -= 1\n\n    return result\n\n# Example usage:\nnums1 = [1, 7, 11]\nnums2 = [2, 4, 6]\nk = 3\nprint(k_smallest_pairs(nums1, nums2, k))  # Output: [[1, 2], [1, 4], [1, 6]]\n```\n\n- Explanation of the solution:\nThe solution initializes a min-heap with the first element of `nums1` paired with the first element of `nums2`. It then iterates `k` times or until the heap is empty, popping the smallest pair from the heap and adding it to the result list.

Tuples are sequences, just like lists, but the main difference is that tuples cannot be changed after they are created. In this problem, we are given a list of tuples, each containing two integers.\n\n2. **Lists**: A list is a collection which is ordered and changeable. In Python, lists are written with square brackets. We are given a list of tuples to process.\n\n3. **Iteration**: Iterating over a list means going through elements one by one. As we iterate, we can perform operations on each element.\n\n4. **Minimum Value Tracking**: While iterating, we can keep track of the minimum value by comparing the current value with a stored minimum value and updating the stored value if the current one is smaller.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Closest Pair of Points Problem**: Given a list of points on a plane, find the pair of points with the smallest Euclidean distance between them. This problem involves iterating over pairs of points and calculating the distance between them, keeping track of the minimum.\n\n2. **Maximum Scalar Product of Two Vectors**: Given two vectors, find a permutation of these vectors such that their scalar product is maximum. This involves sorting and multiplying corresponding elements of the vectors.\n\n3. **Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock**: Given an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i, find the maximum profit you can achieve by buying and selling the stock only once. This involves iterating through the array while keeping track of the minimum price seen so far and the maximum profit that can be achieved.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\nWe will iterate through the list of tuples, calculate the product of the two integers in each tuple, and update the minimum product if the current product is less than the previously found minimum product.

Initialize a variable to store the minimum value. If you know the list contains at least one integer, you can initialize this to the first integer you find. Otherwise, you might initialize it to `None` or a very large number.\n\n2. Loop through each element in the list using a `for` loop.\n\n3. Inside the loop, check if the current element is an integer. You can use the `isinstance()` function for this check.\n\n4.

Python provides a rich set of methods to handle strings, which makes it a preferred language for string manipulation tasks.\n\nTo convert a snake case string to camel case, you can follow these steps:\n1.

Iterate over the list of words and capitalize the first letter of each word using the `capitalize()` method, except for the first word which should remain lowercase.\n3.

This is a fundamental operation in set theory that is used to find common elements between two sets. In the context of lists in Python, we can convert lists to sets and then use set intersection to check if there is any common element.\n\n## Tutorial:\nSet Intersection is a basic operation where you have two sets, and you want to find out which elements are present in both. In Python, sets are collections of unordered, unique items. You can perform intersection using the `&` operator or the `.intersection()` method.\n\nHere's a quick example of how set intersection works in Python:\n\n```python\nset1 = {1, 2, 3, 4}\nset2 = {3, 4, 5, 6}\n\n# Using the & operator\nintersection = set1 & set2\nprint(intersection)  # Output: {3, 4}\n\n# Using the .intersection() method\nintersection = set1.intersection(set2)\nprint(intersection)  # Output: {3, 4}\n```\n\nIf the intersection is not empty, it means there are common elements. If it's empty, there are no common elements.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Common Elements in Two Arrays**: Given two integer arrays, write a function to find the common elements between them.\n   - Solution: Convert both arrays to sets and use set intersection to find common elements.\n   - Python3 code:\n   ```python\n   def common_elements(arr1, arr2):\n       return list(set(arr1) & set(arr2))\n   ```\n\n2. **Disjoint Sets**: Given two sets, determine if they are disjoint (i.e., they have no common elements).\n   - Solution: Perform a set intersection and check if the result is an empty set.\n   - Python3 code:\n   ```python\n   def are_disjoint(set1, set2):\n       return not set1 & set2\n   ```\n\n3. **First Repeated Element**: Given a list of integers, find the first repeated element.\n   - Solution: Iterate through the list and keep adding elements to a set. If an element is already in the set, it's the first repeated element.\n   - Python3 code:\n   ```python\n   def first_repeated_element(lst):\n       seen = set()\n       for element in lst:\n           if element in seen:\n               return element\n           seen.add(element)\n       return None\n   ```\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n- Explanation of the solution:\n  To solve the original problem, we will convert both lists to sets and then perform an intersection.

If the fractional part of the number is .5 or higher, it rounds up; otherwise, it rounds down.\n\n### Summation:\nSummation is the process of adding numbers together. In Python, this can be done using the built-in `sum()` function, which takes an iterable (like a list) and returns the sum of its elements.\n\n### Multiplication:\nAfter obtaining the sum, we multiply it by the length of the list. The length of a list can be found using the `len()` function in Python.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Rounding Grades**: Students receive grades that need to be rounded according to specific rules (e.g., if the difference between the grade and the next multiple of 5 is less than 3, round the grade up to the next multiple of 5). The solution involves iterating through the list of grades, applying the rounding rules, and returning the new grades.\n\n2. **Accumulate Points**: Given a list of points where each point is a float, round each point to the nearest integer and calculate the total points. The solution involves rounding each point and then summing them up.\n\n3. **Weighted Sum**: Given a list of numbers and a list of weights, round each number and then calculate the sum of each rounded number multiplied by its corresponding weight. The solution involves rounding each number, multiplying it by the weight, and then summing the results.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\n- We will iterate through the given list `list1` and round each element using the `round()` function.\n- We will then sum the rounded numbers using the `sum()` function.\n- Finally, we will multiply the sum by the length of the list using the `len()` function and return the result.\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List, Union\n\ndef round_and_sum(list1: List[Union[float, int]]) -> int:\n    # Round each number in the list\n    rounded_numbers = [round(num) for num in list1]\n    # Calculate the sum of the rounded numbers\n    total_sum = sum(rounded_numbers)\n    # Multiply the sum by the length of the list\n    result = total_sum * len(list1)\n    return result\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(round_and_sum([1.2, 2.5, 3.7, 4.4]))  # Output should be 48\n```\n\nIn the example usage, the rounded list is `[1, 3, 4, 4]` with a sum of `12`. The length of the list is `4`, so the final result is `12 * 4 = 48`."], "prompt_tokens": [223], "completion_tokens": [658], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": false, "task_id": "mbpp_419_round_and_sum"}

Concatenation is the operation of joining character strings end-to-end. In Python, strings can be concatenated using the `+` operator or the `join()` method. For tuples, the `join()` method is typically used by first converting all elements to strings, as `join()` can only be applied to an iterable of strings.\n\n## Tutorial:\nString concatenation is a fundamental operation in many programming tasks. In Python, there are several ways to concatenate strings:\n\n1. Using the `+` operator:\n```python\nstring1 = \"Hello\"\nstring2 = \"World\"\nresult = string1 + \" \" + string2  # result is \"Hello World\"\n```\n\n2. Using the `join()` method:\n```python\nstring_list = [\"Hello\", \"World\"]\ndelimiter = \" \"\nresult = delimiter.join(string_list)  # result is \"Hello World\"\n```\nThe `join()` method is more efficient than using `+` in a loop, especially when concatenating a large number of strings.\n\nWhen dealing with tuples, if the tuple contains non-string elements, you must first convert them to strings before using `join()`. This can be done with a generator expression or a list comprehension:\n```python\ntest_tup = (\"Hello\", \"World\", 123, \"Python\")\nresult = \" \".join(str(item) for item in test_tup)  # result is \"Hello World 123 Python\"\n```\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Joining Strings with a Separator**:\n   Problem: Given a list of strings, concatenate them using a specific separator.\n   Solution: Use the `join()` method with the separator as the delimiter.\n   ```python\n   def join_strings(string_list, separator):\n       return separator.join(string_list)\n   ```\n\n2. **Creating a CSV Line from Data**:\n   Problem: Given a list of values (strings, integers, floats), create a CSV (comma-separated values) line.\n   Solution: Convert all elements to strings and use `join()` with a comma.\n   ```python\n   def create_csv_line(data_list):\n       return \",\".join(str(item) for item in data_list)\n   ```\n\n3. **Generating a URL Query String**:\n   Problem: Given a dictionary of parameters, generate a URL query string.\n   Solution: Iterate through the dictionary, convert keys and values to strings, and concatenate them with `=` and `&`.\n   ```python\n   def generate_query_string(params):\n       return \"&\".join(f\"{key}={value}\" for key, value in params.items())\n   ```\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\nThe function `concatenate_tuple` will take a tuple as input and concatenate each element with a delimiter.

This means that we can use indexing to access specific characters in a string. Indexing in Python is zero-based, so the first character of a string is at index 0. Negative indices can be used to access characters from the end of the string, with -1 being the index of the last character.\n\nHere's a quick overview of string indexing and slicing in Python:\n- `string[i]` - Accesses the character at index `i`.\n- `string[-1]` - Accesses the last character of the string.\n- `string[start:end]` - Accesses a substring from index `start` to `end - 1`.\n- `string[start:end:step]` - Accesses a substring from index `start` to `end - 1`, with a step of `step`.\n\nWhen working with tuples, we can iterate over them using a loop, and apply string operations to each element. Tuples are immutable, so we cannot change their contents, but we can create new tuples or other data structures based on their contents.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Reverse Strings in a Tuple**: Given a tuple of strings, write a function to return a new tuple with the strings reversed.\n   Solution: Iterate over the tuple and reverse each string using slicing `string[::-1]`.

In Python, you can use a for loop to iterate over the elements of a list. If the list contains other lists (sublists), you can use a nested for loop to iterate over the elements of these sublists.\n\nHere's a simple example of how you might iterate over a nested list:\n\n```python\nnested_list = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]\nfor sublist in nested_list:\n    for item in sublist:\n        print(item)\n```\n\nThis will print each number in each sublist.

The algorithm involves iterating over each element in the list, checking if it is odd (typically using the modulo operator `%`), and then collecting those elements that satisfy the condition.\n\n## Tutorial:\nTo filter odd numbers from a list in Python, you can use a simple for loop with an if statement, or a more concise list comprehension.\n\n1. **For Loop with If Statement:**\n   You can iterate through the list using a for loop and check each number with an if statement to see if it is odd. If the number is odd (i.e., `num % 2 != 0`), you append it to a new list.\n\n2. **List Comprehension:**\n   Python's list comprehension provides a more concise way to create lists. The syntax is `[expression for item in iterable if condition]`. For filtering odd numbers, the expression would be the number itself, the iterable would be the original list, and the condition would check if the number is odd.\n\n3. **Using the `filter()` Function:**\n   Python also provides a built-in function `filter()` that constructs an iterator from elements of an iterable for which a function returns true. You can pass a lambda function that checks for odd numbers as the first argument and the list as the second argument.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Filtering Prime Numbers:**\n   Similar to filtering odd numbers, you can filter prime numbers from a list by checking each number for primality. The solution involves iterating over the list and using a helper function to check if a number is prime.\n\n2. **Selecting Numbers Divisible by a Given Number:**\n   This problem requires filtering numbers that are divisible by a specific number, say `k`. The solution is similar to filtering odd numbers, but the condition in the if statement or list comprehension changes to `num % k == 0`.\n\n3. **Extracting Elements Based on Index:**\n   Another variation could be to extract elements that are at odd indices in the list. The solution would involve iterating over the list with an index and checking if the index is odd, rather than the value at that index.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n- Explanation of the solution:\n  The solution involves using a list comprehension to iterate over each number in the input list `nums` and include it in the new list if it is odd (i.e., `num % 2 != 0`).\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef filter_oddnumbers(nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n    # Use list comprehension to filter odd numbers\n    return [num for num in nums if num % 2 != 0]\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(filter_oddnumbers([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]))  # Output: [1, 3, 5]\n```\n\nThis code defines the function `filter_oddnumbers` which takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list containing only the odd integers from the original list.

However, for this simple problem, using `datetime` would be overkill.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Reverse a String**: Given a string, write a function to reverse it.

Shell sort is an in-place comparison sort which is a generalization of insertion sort. The main idea of Shell sort is to allow the exchange of far items first to make the array \"hollower\" and then progressively reduce the gap between the elements to be compared.\n\n## Tutorial:\nShell sort works by comparing elements separated by a gap of several positions. This allows elements to move more than one position up or down in a single operation and helps to reduce the total number of operations needed to sort the list as compared to a simple insertion sort.\n\nThe algorithm uses a sequence of gaps, starting with a large gap and shrinking by a certain factor with each successive pass until the gap is 1. At each pass, the list is sorted using a modified insertion sort that can jump over the gap. The choice of gap sequence can affect the performance of the algorithm, but a common sequence is to divide the gap by 2 each time.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide to how Shell sort works:\n1. Choose an initial gap, often the length of the list divided by 2.\n2. Perform a gapped insertion sort for this gap size. The first gapped insertion sort will sort pairs of elements far apart from each other, then progressively reduce the gap and create a list that is \"gappier\" than a normal insertion sort.\n3. After completing the gapped insertion sort, reduce the gap size and repeat the process until the gap size is 1.\n4. When the gap size is 1, the list will be sorted using a standard insertion sort, but by this time, the list is already \"almost sorted,\" which makes the final insertion sort much faster.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Sorting an array with a specific gap sequence**: Given an array and a specific gap sequence, sort the array using the Shell sort algorithm with the provided gap sequence.\n   \n2. **Optimizing Shell sort for a large dataset**: Given a large dataset, find the most efficient gap sequence to sort the array using Shell sort and then perform the sorting.\n   \n3. **Comparing Shell sort with other sorting algorithms**: Given multiple unsorted arrays, sort each one using Shell sort, insertion sort, and another sorting algorithm of your choice, and compare the time taken for each.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\nThe Shell sort function will take a list of integers as input and return a sorted list.

Sorting and Merging\n\nFor this problem, we will focus on the hashing method using a set, as it provides a good balance between simplicity and efficiency.\n\n## Tutorial:\n### Hashing (Using a Set):\nHashing involves creating a data structure that can store elements in such a way that checking for the existence of an element can be done in constant time (on average). In Python, a set is a built-in data structure that uses hashing.\n\nHere's how you can use a set to find a common element between two lists:\n1. Insert all elements of the first list into a set.\n2. Iterate through the second list and check if any element is present in the set.\n3. If an element from the second list is found in the set, it means there is a common element.\n\nThis method is efficient because:\n- Inserting an element into a set is O(1) on average.\n- Checking for the existence of an element in a set is O(1) on average.\n\nTherefore, the overall time complexity is O(n + m), where n is the length of the first list and m is the length of the second list.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Intersection of Two Arrays**: Given two arrays, write a function to compute their intersection. The solution involves using a set to store the elements of one array and then iterating through the second array to find common elements.\n\n2. **Two Sum**: Given an array of integers and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target. You can use a set (or a hashmap) to store the elements and their indices, and then check if the complement (target - current element) exists in the set.\n\n3. **Longest Consecutive Sequence**: Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence. You can use a set to store all elements, and then iterate through the set to find consecutive sequences by checking if the current element minus one is in the set.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n### Explanation of the solution:\nWe will use a set to store all elements of the first list. Then, we will iterate through the second list and check if any element is present in the set. If we find a common element, we return `True`.

The median (or midline) of a trapezium is a line segment that connects the midpoints of the non-parallel sides and is parallel to the bases. The length of the median can be found using a simple formula that involves the lengths of the two parallel sides (bases) of the trapezium.\n\nThe core concept here is the median length formula for a trapezium, which is given by:\n\\[ \\text{Median length} = \\frac{\\text{Base}_1 + \\text{Base}_2}{2} \\]\n\nNo complex algorithms are needed for this problem, as it is a direct application of the formula.\n\n## Tutorial:\nIn geometry, a trapezium is a quadrilateral with at least one pair of parallel sides. The parallel sides are known as the bases, and the other two sides are called the legs. The median (also known as the midline or midsegment) of a trapezium is a segment that connects the midpoints of the legs and is parallel to the bases.\n\nThe length of the median is important because it represents the average length of the bases. This property is useful in various geometric calculations, such as finding the area of a trapezium or dividing it into two congruent trapeziums.\n\nTo calculate the median length, you can use the formula mentioned above. This formula is derived from the fact that the median divides the trapezium into two smaller trapeziums, each with half the area of the original. Since the area of a trapezium is calculated as the product of its height and the average of its bases, the median length is simply the average of the two bases.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Area of a Trapezium**: Given the lengths of the bases and the height, calculate the area of a trapezium.\n   Solution: Use the formula \\( \\text{Area} = \\frac{\\text{Base}_1 + \\text{Base}_2}{2} \\times \\text{Height} \\).\n   Python3 code:\n   ```python\n   def area_trapezium(base1, base2, height):\n       return (base1 + base2) * height / 2\n   ```\n\n2. **Dividing a Trapezium**: Given a trapezium, divide it into two trapeziums of equal area by drawing a line parallel to the bases.\n   Solution: The line that divides the trapezium into two equal areas is the median. Calculate the median length and use it to draw the dividing line.\n   Python3 code:\n   ```python\n   def divide_trapezium(base1, base2):\n       median_length = (base1 + base2) / 2\n       return median_length\n   ```\n\n3. **Finding the Length of Diagonals**: Given the lengths of the bases, legs, and height of a trapezium, calculate the lengths of the diagonals.\n   Solution: This problem is more complex and requires the use of the Pythagorean theorem and possibly trigonometry, depending on the information given.\n   Python3 code: (This would be more complex and is not provided here as it is beyond the scope of the current problem.)\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n- Explanation of the solution:\n  The solution to the original problem is straightforward. We simply apply the median length formula for a trapezium, which requires the lengths of the two bases. We add the lengths of the bases and divide by 2 to get the median length.\n\n- Python3 code to solve the problem:\n```python\ndef median_trapezium(base1: int, base2: int, height: int) -> float:\n    \"\"\"\n    Write a function to find the median length of a trapezium.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Apply the median length formula for a trapezium\n    median_length = (base1 + base2) / 2\n    return median_length\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(median_trapezium(10, 20, 5))  # Output should be 15.0\n```\n\nThe function `median_trapezium` takes three arguments: `base1`, `base2`, and `height`.

They are commonly used for string searching and manipulation. In Python, the `re` module provides a set of functions that allows us to search a string for a match:\n\n- `re.match()`: Determines if the regex matches at the beginning of the string.\n- `re.search()`: Scans through a string, looking for any location where the regex matches.\n- `re.findall()`: Finds all substrings where the regex matches and returns them as a list.\n- `re.sub()`: Replaces the matches with a string.\n\nTo define a regex pattern, you use a special syntax to denote different types of patterns. For example:\n- `a`: Matches the character 'a' literally.\n- `b+`: Matches one or more occurrences of 'b'.\n- `^`: Anchors the match at the start of the string.\n- `$`: Anchors the match at the end of the string.\n\nIn our problem, we need to match a string that has an 'a' followed by one or more 'b's.

For example, to get only the even numbers from the list of squares, you can do:\n\n```python\neven_squares = [x for x in squares if x % 2 == 0]\n```\n\nThis will result in a list containing only the even squares.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Finding all prime numbers in a range**: Given a range of integers, return a list of all prime numbers within that range.\n   - Solution: Use list comprehension with a condition that checks for primality.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def is_prime(n):\n         if n <= 1:\n             return False\n         for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):\n             if n % i == 0:\n                 return False\n         return True\n\n     primes = [x for x in range(2, 50) if is_prime(x)]\n     ```\n\n2. **Filtering out strings that don't contain a certain substring**: Given a list of strings, return a list of strings that contain a given substring.\n   - Solution: Use list comprehension with a condition that checks for the presence of the substring.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def filter_strings(strings, substring):\n         return [s for s in strings if substring in s]\n\n     filtered_strings = filter_strings([\"hello\", \"world\", \"helium\"], \"hel\")\n     ```\n\n3. **Selecting tuples based on a condition**: Given a list of tuples where each tuple contains two numbers, return a list of tuples where the first number is greater than the second.\n   - Solution: Use list comprehension with a condition that compares the elements of the tuples.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def filter_tuples(tuples):\n         return [t for t in tuples if t[0] > t[1]]\n\n     filtered_tuples = filter_tuples([(1, 2), (3, 2), (5, 5)])\n     ```\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n- Explanation of the solution:\n  The solution involves iterating over each element in the input list and checking if it is negative. If the element is negative, it is included in the new list that will be returned.\n\n- Python3 code:\n  ```python\n  from typing import List\n\n  def neg_nos(list1: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n      \"\"\"\n      Write a python function to return the negative numbers in a list.\n      \"\"\"\n      return [num for num in list1 if num < 0]\n\n  # Example usage:\n  example_list = [1, -2, 3, -4, 5]\n  print(neg_nos(example_list))  # Output: [-2, -4]\n  ```"], "prompt_tokens": [205], "completion_tokens": [789], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": false, "task_id": "mbpp_436_neg_nos"}

Specifically, we need to iterate over the characters in the string and determine whether their index is odd or even. Based on this, we can decide whether to include each character in the resulting string.\n\n## Tutorial:\nString manipulation is a common task in programming, and it involves altering, parsing, or analyzing strings in various ways. In Python, strings are immutable, meaning that once a string is created, it cannot be changed. However, we can create new strings based on operations performed on the original string.\n\nTo solve problems involving string manipulation, you often need to iterate over the characters in a string. This can be done using a `for` loop or a list comprehension. In Python, you can access characters in a string by their index, which starts at 0 for the first character.\n\nWhen you need to check if an index is odd or even, you can use the modulo operator `%`. An index `i` is even if `i % 2 == 0` and odd if `i % 2 == 1`.\n\nHere's a simple example of iterating over a string and printing each character with its index:\n\n```python\nstr1 = \"Hello, World!\"\nfor i, char in enumerate(str1):\n    print(f\"Index: {i}, Character: {char}\")\n```\n\nIn competitive programming, efficient string manipulation is crucial, and understanding how to iterate and modify strings based on certain conditions is a key skill.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Reverse String**: Given a string, write a function to reverse it.\n   - Solution: Iterate over the string in reverse order and append each character to a new string.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def reverse_string(s: str) -> str:\n         return s[::-1]\n     ```\n\n2. **Check for Palindrome**: Given a string, determine if it is a palindrome (reads the same backward as forward).\n   - Solution: Compare the string with its reverse and check if they are equal.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def is_palindrome(s: str) -> bool:\n         return s == s[::-1]\n     ```\n\n3. **Replace Vowels with Asterisk**: Given a string, replace all vowels in the string with an asterisk '*'.\n   - Solution: Iterate over the string and replace each vowel with an asterisk.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def replace_vowels(s: str) -> str:\n         vowels = \"aeiouAEIOU\"\n         return ''.join(['*' if char in vowels else char for char in s])\n     ```\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n- Explanation of the solution:\n  To remove odd characters from a string, we iterate over the string and include only those characters whose index is even (i.e., not odd). We can use a list comprehension to create a list of the even-indexed characters and then join them back into a string.\n\n- Python3 code to solve the problem:\n  ```python\n  def remove_odd(str1: str) -> str:\n      \"\"\"\n      Write a function to remove odd characters in a string.\n      \"\"\"\n      return ''.join([char for i, char in enumerate(str1) if i % 2 == 0])\n  ```\n\nThis code uses `enumerate` to get both the index and the character as we iterate over the string. The list comprehension checks if the index `i` is even, and if so, includes the character in the new list.

A bidirectional pair of tuples means that if you have a tuple `(a, b)`, you also have the tuple `(b, a)` in the list.

Tuples are often used to store related pieces of information.\n\n2. **Sets**: A set is an unordered collection of distinct hashable objects. They are useful when you want to keep track of a collection of elements, but don't care about the order or frequency of those elements.\n\n3. **Hashing**: Hashing is the process of converting an object into an integer (hash) that represents the object. Hashable objects in Python, like tuples, can be used as keys in dictionaries or elements in sets.\n\nThe algorithm to solve the problem is as follows:\n- Initialize an empty set to keep track of the tuples we have seen.\n- Iterate over each tuple in the list.\n- For each tuple, check if the reverse of the tuple exists in the set.\n- If it does, increment the count of bidirectional pairs.\n- Add the current tuple to the set.\n- Return the count of bidirectional pairs.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Finding Symmetric Pairs in an Array**: Given an array of pairs, find all the symmetric pairs, i.e., pairs that appear as (a, b) and (b, a).\n\n2. **Count Distinct Pairs with a Given Sum**: Given an array of integers and a value sum, count the number of distinct pairs that add up to the given sum.\n\n3. **Detecting a Cycle in a Directed Graph**: Given a directed graph, determine whether the graph contains a cycle. This problem can be solved using depth-first search (DFS) and keeping track of visited nodes.\n\nFor each of these problems, the solution would involve iterating over the data structure, using hashing to keep track of seen elements, and applying the specific logic required to solve the problem.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\n- We will use a set to keep track of the tuples we have seen.\n- We will iterate over the list of tuples, and for each tuple, we will check if its reverse is in the set.\n- If the reverse is in the set, it means we have found a bidirectional pair, and we will increment our count.\n- We will add each tuple to the set after checking for its reverse.\n- Finally, we will return the count of bidirectional pairs.\n\nHere is the Python3 code:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List, Tuple\n\ndef count_bidirectional(test_list: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> int:\n    seen = set()\n    count = 0\n    for a, b in test_list:\n        if (b, a) in seen:\n            count += 1\n        seen.add((a, b))\n    return count\n\n# Example usage:\ntest_list = [(1, 2), (2, 1), (4, 3), (3, 4), (5, 6)]\nprint(count_bidirectional(test_list))  # Output: 2\n```\n\nThis code will correctly count the number of bidirectional tuple pairs in the given list."], "prompt_tokens": [207], "completion_tokens": [736], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": false, "task_id": "mbpp_438_count_bidirectional"}

In Python, strings are immutable, which means you cannot change them in place. However, you can create new strings by concatenating existing ones using the `+` operator or the `join()` method.\n\nTo solve problems involving string manipulation, you often need to iterate over characters or substrings, use slicing to access parts of the string, and apply various string methods to transform the string as needed.\n\nWhen converting numbers to strings or vice versa, you can use the built-in `str()` function to convert an integer to a string, and the `int()` function to convert a string to an integer.\n\nConcatenation of strings is straightforward in Python. You can simply use the `+` operator to join two strings. However, when dealing with a list of strings, it's more efficient to use the `join()` method, which takes an iterable of strings and concatenates them into a single string.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Concatenate Array to Form Minimum Number**: Given a list of non-negative integers, arrange them such that they form the minimum possible number. The solution involves converting the integers to strings, sorting them based on a custom comparator that defines the order, and then concatenating them.\n\n2. **Largest Number**: Similar to the previous problem, but instead of forming the minimum number, you need to arrange the numbers to form the largest possible number.\n\n3. **Add Binary**: Given two binary strings, return their sum (also as a binary string).

In Python, you can iterate over a list using a `for` loop.\n\n```python\nfor element in my_list:\n    # Do something with element\n```\n\n### Conditional Statements:\nConditional statements allow you to execute certain pieces of code based on whether a condition is true or false. In Python, you can use an `if` statement to check conditions.\n\n```python\nif my_condition:\n    # Do something if the condition is true\n```\n\n### Counting:\nTo count the number of times a condition is met, you can initialize a counter variable to zero and increment it each time the condition is true.\n\n```python\ncounter = 0\nfor element in my_list:\n    if my_condition:\n        counter += 1\n```\n\n### Calculating Ratios:\nA ratio is a quantitative relationship between two numbers indicating how many times the first number contains the second. To calculate a ratio in Python, you simply divide one number by another.\n\n```python\nratio = numerator / denominator\n```\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Counting Even Numbers**: Given a list of integers, count how many are even.\n   - Solution: Iterate through the list, use the modulo operator (`%`) to check if a number is even, and increment a counter if it is.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def count_evens(nums):\n         count = 0\n         for num in nums:\n             if num % 2 == 0:\n                 count += 1\n         return count\n     ```\n\n2. **Finding the Percentage of Elements That Meet a Condition**: Given a list of student marks, find the percentage of marks that are above a certain threshold.\n   - Solution: Iterate through the list, check if each mark is above the threshold, count the number of marks that meet the condition, and then calculate the percentage.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def percentage_above_threshold(marks, threshold):\n         count = sum(mark > threshold for mark in marks)\n         return (count / len(marks)) * 100\n     ```\n\n3. **Calculating the Proportion of Characters in a String**: Given a string, calculate the proportion of alphabetic characters to the total number of characters.\n   - Solution: Iterate through the string, use the `str.isalpha()` method to check if a character is alphabetic, count the alphabetic characters, and calculate the proportion.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def alpha_proportion(s):\n         alpha_count = sum(c.isalpha() for c in s)\n         return alpha_count / len(s)\n     ```\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n- Explanation of the solution:\n  To solve the original problem, we will iterate through the list of numbers, count how many are positive, and then calculate the ratio of positive numbers to the total number of elements in the list.\n\n- Python3 code to solve the problem:\n  ```python\n  def positive_count(nums: List[int]) -> float:\n      \"\"\"\n      Write a function to find the ratio of positive numbers in an array of integers.\n      \"\"\"\n      positive_nums_count = sum(1 for num in nums if num > 0)\n      return positive_nums_count / len(nums) if nums else 0\n  ```\n\nIn the code above, we use a generator expression within the `sum()` function to count the positive numbers. We then divide this count by the length of the list to get the ratio. If the list is empty, we return 0 to avoid division by zero."], "prompt_tokens": [205], "completion_tokens": [849], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": false, "task_id": "mbpp_442_positive_count"}

Linear search is a simple search algorithm that checks every element in the list until it finds the target value. In this case, the target is the largest negative number in the list.\n\n## Tutorial:\nLinear search is an algorithm that iterates through a list to find a particular value. It is straightforward and does not require the list to be sorted. The algorithm works by starting at the first element and moving through each element sequentially until the desired value is found or the end of the list is reached.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide to performing a linear search to find the largest negative number in a list:\n1. Initialize a variable to store the largest negative number found. You can set it to a very small number or `None` to indicate that no negative number has been found yet.\n2. Iterate through each element in the list.\n3. For each element, check if it is negative.\n4. If it is negative and either no other negative number has been found or it is larger than the current largest negative number, update the variable with this new number.\n5. After checking all elements, return the variable that holds the largest negative number.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Finding the Smallest Number in a List**: Given a list of integers, find the smallest number. The solution involves iterating through the list and keeping track of the smallest number found so far.\n\n2. **Finding the Closest Number to Zero**: Given a list of integers, find the number closest to zero. If there is a tie, prefer the positive number. The solution involves iterating through the list and comparing the absolute values of the numbers to find the closest to zero.\n\n3. **Counting Negative Numbers in a Sorted Matrix**: Given a matrix with rows and columns sorted in non-increasing order, count the number of negative numbers in it. The solution involves a modified linear search where you can skip certain rows or columns based on the sorted property.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\nThe solution involves iterating through the given list and keeping track of the largest negative number found.

List slicing is a technique in Python that allows you to create a new list containing a subset of the elements from an existing list. It is a common operation in Python and is often used in data manipulation and competitive programming.\n\n## Tutorial:\nList slicing in Python uses the syntax `list[start:stop:step]`, where `start` is the index of the first element to include in the slice, `stop` is the index of the first element to not include in the slice, and `step` is the number of indices to move forward after each element is included.\n\nHere are some key points about list slicing:\n- If `start` is omitted, it defaults to 0 (the beginning of the list).\n- If `stop` is omitted, it defaults to the length of the list (which means slicing until the end of the list).\n- If `step` is omitted, it defaults to 1 (which means every element is included).\n- Negative indices can be used to refer to positions from the end of the list.\n- Slicing a list returns a new list and does not modify the original list.\n\nFor example:\n```python\nmy_list = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nslice1 = my_list[1:4]  # [1, 2, 3]\nslice2 = my_list[:3]   # [0, 1, 2]\nslice3 = my_list[3:]   # [3, 4, 5]\nslice4 = my_list[::2]  # [0, 2, 4]\nslice5 = my_list[-3:]  # [3, 4, 5]\n```\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Rotating a List**: Given a list and a number `n`, rotate the list to the right by `n` places. This can be solved by slicing the list into two parts and then concatenating them in the reverse order.\n\n2. **Finding a Subarray with a Given Sum**: Given a list of integers and a target sum, find a contiguous subarray that sums to the given target. This problem can involve creating subarrays using slicing and then checking their sums.\n\n3. **Flattening a Nested List**: Given a list of lists, flatten it into a single list. This can involve slicing each sublist and then concatenating them together.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\nThe solution involves iterating over each sublist in the given list of lists and trimming it by `K` elements from both the start and the end using list slicing. The trimmed sublists are then collected into a new list of lists.\n\nHere's the Python3 code:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef trim_tuple(test_list: List[List[int]], K: int) -> List[List[int]]:\n    # Initialize an empty list to store the trimmed sublists\n    trimmed_lists = []\n    \n    # Iterate over each sublist in the given list of lists\n    for sublist in test_list:\n        # Trim the sublist by K elements from the start and end using slicing\n        # and append the result to the trimmed_lists\n        trimmed_lists.append(sublist[K:-K] if K < len(sublist) // 2 else [])\n    \n    # Return the list of trimmed sublists\n    return trimmed_lists\n\n# Example usage:\ntest_list = [[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9, 10], [11, 12]]\nK = 1\nprint(trim_tuple(test_list, K))  # Output: [[2, 3, 4, 5], [8, 9], []]\n```\n\nIn this code, we check if `K` is less than half the length of the sublist to ensure that we don't attempt to trim more elements than the sublist contains.

To find the cube of a number, you use the exponentiation operator `**` with an exponent of 3.\n\nHere's a quick tutorial on both methods:\n\n### Using a for loop:\n```python\nresult = []\nfor num in nums:\n    cube = num ** 3\n    result.append(cube)\n```\nIn this method, you initialize an empty list called `result`. You then loop over each number in the input list `nums`, calculate its cube, and append it to the `result` list.\n\n### Using list comprehension:\n```python\nresult = [num ** 3 for num in nums]\n```\nList comprehension is a concise way to create lists. The above line is equivalent to the for loop method but written in a single line. It iterates over each number in `nums`, calculates its cube, and collects the cubes into a new list called `result`.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Square Numbers**: Given a list of integers, return a list of their squares.\n   - Solution: Iterate over the list and square each element using the `**` operator with an exponent of 2.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def square_nums(nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n         return [num ** 2 for num in nums]\n     ```\n\n2. **Sum of Cubes**: Given a list of integers, return the sum of their cubes.\n   - Solution: Iterate over the list, cube each element, and sum them up using the built-in `sum()` function.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def sum_of_cubes(nums: List[int]) -> int:\n         return sum(num ** 3 for num in nums)\n     ```\n\n3. **Power List**: Given a list of integers and an integer `n`, return a list of each number raised to the power of `n`.\n   - Solution: Iterate over the list and raise each element to the power of `n` using the `**` operator.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def power_list(nums: List[int], n: int) -> List[int]:\n         return [num ** n for num in nums]\n     ```\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n- Explanation of the solution:\n  The solution involves iterating over the input list `nums` and calculating the cube of each element by raising it to the power of three.

The core concept here is understanding the definition of Perrin numbers and implementing a sequence generation algorithm efficiently.\n\nPerrin numbers are defined by the recurrence relation:\n```\nP(0) = 3, P(1) = 0, P(2) = 2\nP(n) = P(n-2) + P(n-3) for n > 2\n```\n\nTo solve this problem, we can use either an iterative or a recursive approach with memoization to generate Perrin numbers. However, for competitive programming, an iterative approach is often preferred due to its lower overhead and better performance.\n\n## Tutorial:\nTo generate a sequence of Perrin numbers, we can use a simple iterative approach. We start by initializing an array or list with the base cases of the sequence. Then, for each subsequent number, we calculate it using the recurrence relation and add it to the list.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide to generating Perrin numbers iteratively:\n1. Initialize a list with the first three Perrin numbers: `[3, 0, 2]`.\n2. Iterate from `3` to `n`, where `n` is the index of the last Perrin number we want to calculate.\n3. For each iteration, calculate the next Perrin number by summing the number at the current index minus 2 and the number at the current index minus 3.\n4. Append the calculated number to the list.\n5. After generating all Perrin numbers up to index `n`, sum them up to get the final result.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Fibonacci Sequence**: Given an index `n`, calculate the `n`-th Fibonacci number. The Fibonacci sequence is similar to the Perrin sequence but with different base cases and a slightly different recurrence relation: `F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)` with base cases `F(0) = 0` and `F(1) = 1`.\n\n2. **Tribonacci Sequence**: Given an index `n`, calculate the `n`-th Tribonacci number. The Tribonacci sequence is another similar sequence with the recurrence relation: `T(n) = T(n-1) + T(n-2) + T(n-3)` with base cases `T(0) = 0`, `T(1) = 1`, and `T(2) = 1`.\n\n3. **Padovan Sequence**: Given an index `n`, calculate the `n`-th Padovan number. The Padovan sequence is defined by the recurrence relation: `P(n) = P(n-2) + P(n-3)` with initial values `P(0) = P(1) = P(2) = 1`.\n\nFor each of these problems, the solution involves initializing the sequence with the given base cases and then using a loop to calculate each subsequent number using the respective recurrence relation. The final step is to return the `n`-th number of the sequence.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\nWe will use an iterative approach to generate Perrin numbers up to the given index `n`.

The primary algorithmic technique used here is list comprehension or the filter function in Python, which provides a concise way to create a new list by filtering an existing one.\n\n## Tutorial:\nList comprehension is a concise way to create lists in Python. It consists of brackets containing an expression followed by a `for` clause, then zero or more `for` or `if` clauses. The expressions can be anything, meaning you can put in all kinds of objects in lists.\n\nThe syntax is:\n```python\n[expression for item in list if condition]\n```\n\nThe `filter` function in Python takes in two arguments: a function and a list. The function is called with all the items in the list, and a new list is returned which contains items for which the function evaluates to `True`.\n\nHere is an example of using list comprehension to filter a list:\n```python\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\neven_numbers = [num for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0]\n```\n\nAnd here is an example using the `filter` function:\n```python\ndef is_even(num):\n    return num % 2 == 0\n\neven_numbers = list(filter(is_even, numbers))\n```\n\nBoth of these will result in `even_numbers` being `[2, 4, 6]`.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Filtering Even Numbers**: Given a list of integers, write a function to return a list of even integers.\n   - Solution: Use list comprehension or the `filter` function to check for even numbers.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def filter_even_numbers(nums):\n         return [num for num in nums if num % 2 == 0]\n     ```\n\n2. **Finding Prime Numbers**: Given a range of integers, write a function to return a list of prime numbers within that range.\n   - Solution: Use list comprehension with a function that checks for primality.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def is_prime(n):\n         if n <= 1:\n             return False\n         for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):\n             if n % i == 0:\n                 return False\n         return True\n\n     def filter_prime_numbers(start, end):\n         return [num for num in range(start, end + 1) if is_prime(num)]\n     ```\n\n3. **Extracting Specific Length Words**: Given a list of words, write a function to return a list of words that have a length of exactly 5 letters.\n   - Solution: Use list comprehension to filter the list based on word length.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def extract_five_letter_words(words):\n         return [word for word in words if len(word) == 5]\n     ```\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n- Explanation of the solution:\n  The solution involves iterating over the list of strings and selecting only those strings whose length is equal to the specified size `l`.

For this specific problem, we can use string methods like `replace()`, or we can iterate through the string and build a new string without the whitespace characters.\n\n## Tutorial:\nString manipulation is a common task in programming, and Python provides a rich set of methods to work with strings. Here are some common string manipulation techniques:\n\n1. **String Concatenation**: Combining multiple strings into one.\n2. **String Slicing**: Extracting a part of the string using indices.\n3. **String Methods**: Python has built-in methods like `strip()`, `replace()`, `split()`, and `join()` that are useful for various string operations.\n4. **Regular Expressions**: For more complex string patterns, Python's `re` module allows you to use regular expressions to search, match, and manipulate strings.\n\nFor removing whitespaces, we can use the `replace()` method to replace all occurrences of a space with an empty string. Alternatively, we can iterate through each character in the string and append only non-whitespace characters to a new string.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **String Compression**: Given a string, compress it using the counts of repeated characters. For example, \"aabcccccaaa\" would become \"a2b1c5a3\".\n   - Solution: Iterate through the string, keeping track of the current character and its count.

These problems typically require you to perform basic calculations or comparisons and return a result based on the outcome.\n\nTo solve such problems, you often use:\n\n1. **Arithmetic Operations**: Addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/). In this case, we will use subtraction to find the difference between the actual cost and the sale amount.\n\n2. **Conditional Statements**: `if` statements allow you to execute certain code only when a particular condition is true.

We start from 2 (the smallest even number) and go up to `n`, incrementing by 2 each time to ensure we only consider even numbers. For each number, we check if it is a factor of `n` by using the modulo operator. If it is a factor, we add it to our sum. Finally, we return the sum.\n\nHere is the Python3 code:\n\n```python\ndef sumofFactors(n: int) -> int:\n    sum_even_factors = 0\n    # Start from 2 and go up to n, incrementing by 2 to stay even\n    for i in range(2, n+1, 2):\n        if n % i == 0:  # Check if i is a factor of n\n            sum_even_factors += i\n    return sum_even_factors\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(sumofFactors(10))  # Output should be 2 + 10 = 12\n```\n\nThis code will correctly calculate the sum of even factors for any positive integer `n`."], "prompt_tokens": [199], "completion_tokens": [695], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": true, "task_id": "mbpp_453_sumofFactors"}

The simplest way to solve this problem is by using the `in` operator to check if 'z' is present in the word. Alternatively, we can use regular expressions (regex) for more complex pattern matching.\n\n## Tutorial:\nString manipulation is a common task in programming where you perform operations on strings such as searching, splitting, concatenating, and replacing characters. Python provides a rich set of methods to work with strings.\n\nPattern matching, often done with regular expressions, is a powerful tool for searching and manipulating strings based on patterns. A regular expression is a sequence of characters that define a search pattern. Python's `re` module provides support for regular expressions.\n\nHere's a quick overview of using regular expressions in Python:\n- Import the `re` module using `import re`.\n- Use `re.search(pattern, string)` to search for the first location where the regular expression pattern produces a match with the string.\n- Use `re.match(pattern, string)` to check if the beginning of the string matches the pattern.\n- Use `re.findall(pattern, string)` to find all substrings where the regular expression pattern produces a match, and returns them as a list.\n\nFor our simple problem, we don't need the full power of regular expressions, but it's good to know they are available for more complex scenarios.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Finding a Specific Character in a String:**\n   Problem: Given a string, find if the character 'x' is present in it.\n   Solution: Use the `in` operator or `re.search()` to check for 'x'.\n   Python3 code:\n   ```python\n   def contains_x(text):\n       return 'x' in text\n   ```\n\n2. **Matching a Pattern at the Start of a String:**\n   Problem: Given a string, check if it starts with 'http'.\n   Solution: Use `str.startswith()` or `re.match()` with the pattern '^http'.\n   Python3 code:\n   ```python\n   def starts_with_http(text):\n       return text.startswith('http') or bool(re.match('^http', text))\n   ```\n\n3. **Finding All Digits in a String:**\n   Problem: Given a string, find all digits in it.\n   Solution: Use `re.findall()` with the pattern '\\d+'.\n   Python3 code:\n   ```python\n   import re\n   def find_all_digits(text):\n       return re.findall('\\d+', text)\n   ```\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\nThe problem is to check if a given word contains the letter 'z'.

The basic syntax for a conditional statement in Python is:\n\n```python\nif condition:\n    # code to execute if condition is true\n```\n\nYou can also have an `else` block to execute code if the condition is false:\n\n```python\nif condition:\n    # code to execute if condition is true\nelse:\n    # code to execute if condition is false\n```\n\nFor multiple conditions, you can use `elif` (short for else if):\n\n```python\nif condition1:\n    # code to execute if condition1 is true\nelif condition2:\n    # code to execute if condition2 is true\nelse:\n    # code to execute if none of the above conditions are true\n```\n\nIn the context of our problem, we will use an `if` statement to check if the given month number is one of the months that have 31 days.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Leap Year Checker**: Write a function to check if a given year is a leap year or not. A leap year is exactly divisible by 4 except for century years (years ending with 00). The century year is a leap year only if it is perfectly divisible by 400.\n\n2. **Day of the Week Calculator**: Given a date, write a function to calculate the day of the week. This problem can be solved using Zeller's Congruence algorithm, which is an algorithm devised by Christian Zeller to calculate the day of the week for any Julian or Gregorian calendar date.\n\n3. **Magic Dates**: A magic date is a date where the day multiplied by the month is equal to the two-digit year.

Write a function to check if a given date is a magic date.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n- Explanation of the solution:\nThe solution involves checking if the given month number is one of the following: January (1), March (3), May (5), July (7), August (8), October (10), or December (12).

This is a basic operation that can be performed in Python using slicing.\n\n## Tutorial:\nReversing a string in Python can be done using the slicing syntax. Slicing allows you to obtain a substring from a string, and by providing a step argument of -1, you can reverse the string. The syntax for reversing a string `s` is `s[::-1]`.\n\nHere's a quick tutorial on how to reverse a string in Python:\n\n```python\noriginal_string = \"hello\"\nreversed_string = original_string[::-1]\nprint(reversed_string)  # Output: \"olleh\"\n```\n\nThe `[::-1]` slicing works as follows:\n- The first colon `:` indicates the start of the slice. Since there is no number before it, it starts from the beginning of the string.\n- The second colon `:` indicates the end of the slice. Since there is no number after it, it goes all the way to the end of the string.\n- The `-1` indicates the step, which in this case means we are stepping through the string backwards, effectively reversing it.\n\nThis simple technique is very powerful and can be used in various problems that require string manipulation.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Palindrome Check**: Given a string, determine if it is a palindrome (reads the same backward as forward). To solve this, you can reverse the string and compare it to the original. If they are the same, the string is a palindrome.\n\n```python\ndef is_palindrome(s: str) -> bool:\n    return s == s[::-1]\n```\n\n2. **Reverse Words in a Sentence**: Given a sentence, reverse each word in the sentence while keeping the word order the same. You can split the sentence into words, reverse each word, and then join them back together.\n\n```python\ndef reverse_words(sentence: str) -> str:\n    words = sentence.split()\n    reversed_words = [word[::-1] for word in words]\n    return ' '.join(reversed_words)\n```\n\n3. **String Permutation**: Given a string, return all possible permutations of the characters in the string. This is a more complex problem that can be solved using recursion or backtracking, but at its core, it involves manipulating strings and reversing them as part of the process.\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef get_permutations(s: str) -> List[str]:\n    if len(s) <= 1:\n        return [s]\n    else:\n        perms = []\n        for i, char in enumerate(s):\n            for perm in get_permutations(s[:i] + s[i+1:]):\n                perms.append(char + perm)\n        return perms\n```\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\nThe solution involves iterating over the list of strings and reversing each string using the slicing method described above. The reversed strings are then collected into a new list, which is returned.\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef reverse_string_list(stringlist: List[str]) -> List[str]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Write a function to reverse each string in a given list of string values.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Reverse each string in the list using a list comprehension\n    reversed_list = [s[::-1] for s in stringlist]\n    return reversed_list\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(reverse_string_list([\"hello\", \"world\"]))  # Output: [\"olleh\", \"dlrow\"]\n```\n\nThis code defines a function `reverse_string_list` that takes a list of strings as input and returns a new list with each string reversed.

One such method is `isupper()`, which checks if all the characters in a string are uppercase. To solve problems involving string manipulation, you often iterate over the string, apply some condition, and then construct a new string based on that condition.\n\nHere's a brief tutorial on how to use `isupper()` and list comprehension to manipulate strings:\n\n- `isupper()`: This method returns `True` if all the characters in the string are uppercase letters, otherwise it returns `False`.\n\n```python\ns = \"HELLO\"\nprint(s.isupper())  # Output: True\n\ns = \"Hello\"\nprint(s.isupper())  # Output: False\n```\n\n- List comprehension: This is a concise way to create lists in Python.

It can be used to apply an operation to a range of items and construct a list from the results.\n\nThe syntax of list comprehension is as follows:\n```python\n[expression for item in iterable if condition]\n```\n- `expression` is the item that will be added to the list.\n- `item` is the variable that takes the value of the item inside the iterable in each iteration.\n- `iterable` is a collection of items that can be iterated over (like a list, range, etc.).\n- `condition` is an optional part. If it is provided, the expression will be added to the list only if the condition is true.\n\nHere's a simple example of list comprehension:\n```python\nsquares = [x**2 for x in range(10)]\n```\nThis will create a list of squares of numbers from 0 to 9.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Flatten a Matrix**: Given a 2D matrix, flatten it into a 1D list.\n   - Solution: Use list comprehension to iterate through each row and each element within the row.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def flatten(matrix):\n         return [element for row in matrix for element in row]\n     ```\n\n2. **Filter Even Numbers**: Given a list of numbers, create a new list with only the even numbers.\n   - Solution: Use list comprehension with a condition to check for even numbers.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def filter_even(numbers):\n         return [num for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0]\n     ```\n\n3. **Capitalize Words**: Given a list of words, create a new list with each word capitalized.\n   - Solution: Use list comprehension to apply the `str.capitalize` method to each word.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def capitalize_words(words):\n         return [word.capitalize() for word in words]\n     ```\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n- Explanation of the solution:\n  The solution involves using list comprehension to iterate through each sublist in the given list `lst` and extract the first element of each sublist.\n\n- Python3 code to solve the problem:\n  ```python\n  def Extract(lst: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:\n      return [sublist[0] for sublist in lst if sublist]\n  ```\n\nIn the provided code, `sublist[0]` is the expression that extracts the first element of each sublist.

In Python, strings are iterable, which means you can use a loop to access each character.\n\nThe `isupper()` method is a built-in Python method used to check if a given character is an uppercase letter (`'A'` to `'Z'`).

The key insight is that the maximum product up to a certain point can be affected by the minimum product due to the nature of negative numbers (a negative times a negative becomes a positive). Therefore, we need to keep track of both the maximum and minimum products up to the current position in the array.\n\n## Tutorial:\nDynamic programming is a method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems. It is applicable when the problem can be divided into overlapping subproblems that can be solved independently.\n\nFor the maximum product subarray problem, we use dynamic programming to keep track of the maximum and minimum product subarrays at each index of the array. The reason for keeping track of both is that a negative number can turn a minimum product into a maximum product and vice versa.\n\nHere's the approach:\n1. Initialize two variables, `max_product` and `min_product`, to the first element of the array. These will keep track of the maximum and minimum product subarrays ending at the current index.\n2. Initialize a variable `result` to the first element of the array. This will store the maximum product of any subarray found so far.\n3. Iterate through the array starting from the second element.\n4. At each step, update `max_product` and `min_product` by considering the current element, the product of the current element and the previous `max_product`, and the product of the current element and the previous `min_product`.\n5. Update `result` with the maximum value of `result` and `max_product`.\n6. Return `result` after iterating through the array.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Maximum Sum Subarray (Kadane's Algorithm)**: Given an integer array, find the contiguous subarray which has the largest sum and return its sum. The solution involves a similar dynamic programming approach where we keep track of the maximum sum ending at each index.\n\n2. **Maximum Product of Three Numbers**: Given an integer array, find three numbers whose product is maximum and return the maximum product. The solution involves sorting the array and considering the product of the last three numbers or the product of the first two (which could be negative) and the last one.\n\n3. **Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock**: Given an array where the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i, find the maximum profit you can achieve.

Here are some key points:\n\n- A dictionary in Python is a collection of key-value pairs.\n- You can access the values of a dictionary using `dict.values()` which returns a view object that displays a list of all the values in the dictionary.\n- To check if all values in a dictionary are the same, you can convert the values to a set and see if the length of the set is 1 (since sets only contain unique elements, if all values are the same, the set will contain only one element).\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Finding the Mode of a List**: Given a list of numbers, find the mode (the number that appears most frequently). You can use a dictionary to count the occurrences of each number and then find the maximum value.\n\n2. **Unique Number of Occurrences**: Given an array of integers, check if the number of times each integer appears is unique. This can be solved by using a dictionary to count occurrences and then converting the counts to a set to check for uniqueness.\n\n3. **Anagram Checker**: Given two strings, write a function to determine if they are anagrams of each other (contain the same letters in a different order).

During this transformation, you can apply conditions to filter out certain items.\n\nHere's the general syntax for dictionary comprehension:\n```python\n{key_expression: value_expression for item in iterable if condition}\n```\n- `key_expression` is the expression that defines the keys of the new dictionary.\n- `value_expression` is the expression that defines the values of the new dictionary.\n- `iterable` is the collection of items that you want to iterate over.\n- `condition` is an optional part that if provided, will filter items based on the condition.\n\nIn the context of the given problem, we want to iterate over the items of the input dictionary and create a new dictionary that only includes items where the value is not `None` or an empty string.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Filtering Dictionary by Value**: Given a dictionary and a set of values, write a function to create a new dictionary that only contains items where the value is in the given set.\n   \n   Solution: Use dictionary comprehension to iterate over the items and include only those whose value is in the set.\n   ```python\n   def filter_dict_by_value(input_dict, value_set):\n       return {k: v for k, v in input_dict.items() if v in value_set}\n   ```\n\n2. **Inverting a Dictionary**: Given a dictionary with unique values, write a function to invert the dictionary, swapping keys and values.\n   \n   Solution: Use dictionary comprehension to swap the keys and values.\n   ```python\n   def invert_dict(input_dict):\n       return {v: k for k, v in input_dict.items()}\n   ```\n\n3. **Creating a Dictionary from Two Lists**: Given two lists of equal length, one with keys and one with values, write a function to create a dictionary by zipping the two lists together.\n   \n   Solution: Use dictionary comprehension with `zip` to combine the two lists into a dictionary.\n   ```python\n   def create_dict_from_lists(keys, values):\n       return {k: v for k, v in zip(keys, values)}\n   ```\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\nThe solution involves iterating over the items of the input dictionary and creating a new dictionary that only includes items where the value is neither `None` nor an empty string.

This involves two main concepts:\n1. Identifying subsequences that are strictly increasing.\n2. Calculating the maximum product of these subsequences.\n\n## Tutorial:\nDynamic programming is often applied to optimization problems. In such problems, there can be many possible solutions. Each solution has a value, and we wish to find a solution with the optimal (minimum or maximum) value. To apply dynamic programming, the problem must exhibit the properties of overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure.\n\nOverlapping subproblems mean that the space of subproblems must be small, that is, any recursive algorithm solving the problem should solve the same subproblems over and over, rather than generating new subproblems. For the maximum product subsequence problem, the subproblems are the maximum products for subsequences ending with each element of the array.\n\nOptimal substructure means that optimal solutions to a problem incorporate optimal solutions to related subproblems, which we may solve independently. If a problem has optimal substructure, then we can recursively define an optimal solution. For our problem, this means that the maximum product for a subsequence ending at an element includes the maximum product of a subsequence ending at a previous element.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS)**: Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest increasing subsequence. The solution involves dynamic programming where for each element, you find the length of the LIS ending with that element, by traversing the array and considering all elements before it.\n\n2. **Maximum Sum Increasing Subsequence (MSIS)**: Similar to the LIS, but instead of the length, you need to find the subsequence with the maximum sum. The dynamic programming approach is similar, but instead of lengths, you keep track of sums.\n\n3. **Box Stacking Problem**: You are given a set of n types of rectangular 3-D boxes, where the i^th box has height h(i), width w(i), and depth d(i). The boxes cannot be rotated and can only be stacked on top of one another if each box in the stack is strictly larger than the box above it in width, depth, and height. The objective is to build a stack with the maximum possible height. The solution involves sorting the boxes and applying a variation of the LIS algorithm on the boxes.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\nTo solve the problem, we will use dynamic programming.

The problem requires us to iterate over the elements of a tuple and perform an operation on pairs of elements. Since tuples are immutable in Python, we will need to create a new tuple with the results of our pairwise addition.\n\n## Tutorial:\nTuple manipulation in Python involves accessing, iterating, and sometimes converting tuples to other data types to perform certain operations. Since tuples are immutable, you cannot change their content, but you can create new tuples based on existing ones.\n\nTo iterate over a tuple, you can use a `for` loop or a list comprehension. When you need to perform operations on pairs of elements, you can use the `zip` function, which takes two or more iterables and returns an iterator that aggregates elements based on the iterables passed.\n\nHere's a quick example of how `zip` works:\n\n```python\ntuple1 = (1, 2, 3)\ntuple2 = (4, 5, 6)\nresult = tuple(x + y for x, y in zip(tuple1, tuple2))\nprint(result)  # Output: (5, 7, 9)\n```\n\nIn the example above, `zip` pairs up the elements from `tuple1` and `tuple2`, and the list comprehension adds them together, creating a new tuple with the results.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Rotating a Tuple**: Given a tuple, rotate it `n` positions to the left.\n   - Solution: Use slicing to rotate the tuple.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def rotate_tuple(tup, n):\n         return tup[n:] + tup[:n]\n     ```\n\n2. **Tuple Pair Sum to Target**: Given a tuple of integers and a target sum, find all pairs of numbers that add up to the target.\n   - Solution: Use a set to track seen numbers and iterate over the tuple to find complements.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def pair_sum_to_target(tup, target):\n         seen = set()\n         pairs = []\n         for num in tup:\n             if target - num in seen:\n                 pairs.append((num, target - num))\n             seen.add(num)\n         return pairs\n     ```\n\n3. **Maximum Pairwise Product in a Tuple**: Given a tuple of integers, find the maximum product of two distinct elements.\n   - Solution: Sort the tuple and consider the product of the two largest elements or the product of the two smallest elements (in case of negative numbers).\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def max_pairwise_product(tup):\n         sorted_tup = sorted(tup)\n         return max(sorted_tup[0] * sorted_tup[1], sorted_tup[-1] * sorted_tup[-2])\n     ```\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n- Explanation of the solution:\n  We will iterate over the given tuple using a range that goes from 0 to the length of the tuple minus 1. This is because we want to add each element to its next neighbor, and there is no neighbor for the last element. We will use tuple comprehension to create a new tuple with the pairwise sums.\n\n- Python3 code to solve the problem:\n  ```python\n  def add_pairwise(test_tup: Tuple[int, int, int, int, int]) -> Tuple[int, int, int, int]:\n      # Use tuple comprehension to add each element to the next one\n      return tuple(test_tup[i] + test_tup[i + 1] for i in range(len(test_tup) - 1))\n\n  # Example usage:\n  input_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n  print(add_pairwise(input_tuple))  # Output: (3, 5, 7, 9)\n  ```\n\nIn the code above, `range(len(test_tup) - 1)` ensures that we stop before the last element to avoid an `IndexError`.

The most common sorting algorithms include Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Heap Sort, and Bubble Sort. Python provides a built-in `sort()` method that can be used to sort lists efficiently.\n\n2. **Iteration**: Once the list is sorted, we iterate through the list starting from the first element.

During iteration, if we find that the difference between any two consecutive elements is not one, we return `False`. If we reach the end of the list without finding any non-consecutive elements, we return `True`.\n\n## Example Problems:\nHere are three example problems that involve similar algorithms:\n\n1. **Problem: Find the Missing Number in a Sequence**\n   - Description: Given a list of n-1 integers in the range from 1 to n, there's no duplicate in the list.

In Python, dictionaries are not ordered by default (until Python 3.7, where dictionaries maintain insertion order). However, when we want to sort a dictionary by its values, we need to convert it into a list of tuples (key, value) and then sort that list. The sorting can be done using the built-in `sorted()` function, which allows us to specify a custom sorting key via its `key` parameter.\n\n## Tutorial:\nSorting is a fundamental algorithm in computer science and is used in a wide range of applications. Python provides a built-in `sorted()` function that returns a new sorted list from the items in an iterable.\n\nHere's a quick tutorial on how to use the `sorted()` function:\n\n- Basic sorting: By default, `sorted()` sorts the items in ascending order.\n  ```python\n  sorted_list = sorted([3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9])\n  ```\n\n- Custom sorting with `key`: You can pass a function to the `key` parameter to specify a custom sorting criterion.\n  ```python\n  sorted_list = sorted(iterable, key=lambda x: x[1])  # Sorts by the second item in each element if it's a tuple.\n  ```\n\n- Reverse sorting: To sort in descending order, set the `reverse` parameter to `True`.\n  ```python\n  sorted_list = sorted(iterable, reverse=True)\n  ```\n\nWhen sorting dictionaries by value, we often convert the dictionary into a list of tuples and then sort that list. The `items()` method of a dictionary returns a view object that displays a list of dictionary's (key, value) tuple pairs.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Sorting a list of dictionaries by a specific key**: Given a list of dictionaries, sort the list by the value of a specific key in the dictionaries.\n   Solution: Use the `sorted()` function with a `key` parameter that extracts the value associated with the specified key.\n   ```python\n   def sort_list_of_dicts(lst, key):\n       return sorted(lst, key=lambda x: x[key])\n   ```\n\n2. **Ranking elements based on frequency**: Given a list of elements, rank them based on their frequency, with the most frequent elements first.\n   Solution: Use a dictionary to count the frequencies, then sort the dictionary by value.\n   ```python\n   from collections import Counter\n   def rank_by_frequency(lst):\n       freq = Counter(lst)\n       return sorted(freq.items(), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)\n   ```\n\n3. **Sorting characters in a string by their frequency**: Given a string, sort the characters based on their frequency, with the most frequent characters first.\n   Solution: Similar to the previous problem, count the frequencies using `Counter`, then sort and reconstruct the string.\n   ```python\n   def sort_chars_by_frequency(s):\n       freq = Counter(s)\n       sorted_items = sorted(freq.items(), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)\n       return ''.join(char * count for char, count in sorted_items)\n   ```\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\nTo sort the dictionary by value, we will use the `sorted()` function. We will convert the dictionary into a list of tuples using the `items()` method and then sort this list by the second element of each tuple (which is the value in the original dictionary). The sorted list of tuples is then returned.\n\n```python\nfrom typing import Dict, List, Tuple\n\ndef sort_counter(dict1: Dict[str, int]) -> List[Tuple[str, int]]:\n    # Convert the dictionary into a list of tuples and sort by value (second element of the tuple)\n    sorted_items = sorted(dict1.items(), key=lambda x: x[1])\n    return sorted_items\n```\n\nThis function will return a list of tuples sorted by the dictionary values in ascending order.

In Python, this can be done using built-in methods or by manually converting each character based on its ASCII value.\n\n## Tutorial:\nString manipulation is a common task in programming, and converting the case of characters is a basic operation within this domain. In Python, strings are immutable sequences of Unicode characters. To convert a string to lowercase, you can use the `str.lower()` method, which returns a copy of the string with all the uppercase characters converted to lowercase.\n\nIf you want to implement the conversion manually, you can iterate over each character in the string and check if it is an uppercase letter. In ASCII, uppercase letters range from 65 ('A') to 90 ('Z'), and their lowercase counterparts range from 97 ('a') to 122 ('z'). The difference between the ASCII values of an uppercase letter and its corresponding lowercase letter is 32. Therefore, to convert an uppercase letter to lowercase, you can add 32 to its ASCII value.\n\nHere's a simple example of both methods:\n\n```python\n# Using the built-in str.lower() method\noriginal_string = \"Hello, World!\"\nlowercase_string = original_string.lower()\nprint(lowercase_string)  # Output: \"hello, world!\"\n\n# Manually converting each character\nlowercase_string_manual = \"\"\nfor char in original_string:\n    if 'A' <= char <= 'Z':\n        lowercase_string_manual += chr(ord(char) + 32)\n    else:\n        lowercase_string_manual += char\nprint(lowercase_string_manual)  # Output: \"hello, world!\"\n```\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **String Transformation**: Given a string, transform it such that each letter is shifted by a certain number of places in the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 1, 'A' becomes 'B', 'Z' becomes 'A', and 'a' becomes 'b'. To solve this, you would iterate over each character, determine its position in the alphabet, apply the shift, and then convert it back to a character.\n\n2. **Palindrome Checker**: Write a function to check if a given string is a palindrome, considering only alphanumeric characters and ignoring cases. To solve this, you would first convert the string to lowercase, remove non-alphanumeric characters, and then check if the string reads the same forwards and backwards.\n\n3. **Anagram Checker**: Given two strings, write a function to determine if they are anagrams of each other, ignoring cases. To solve this, you would convert both strings to lowercase and then sort the characters or count the occurrences of each character to compare them.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n- Explanation of the solution:\nThe solution to the original problem is straightforward.

Python provides a rich set of methods to work with strings, which makes tasks like searching, splitting, and replacing substrings straightforward.\n\nTo identify lowercase substrings, we can use the `islower()` method, which checks if all the characters in a string are lowercase. We can iterate over the string and use this method to determine which characters or substrings to remove.\n\nAnother approach is to use list comprehensions or the `filter()` function to filter out unwanted characters based on a condition (in this case, being lowercase).\n\nRegular expressions (regex) can also be used for more complex string manipulation tasks. They provide a powerful way to match patterns within strings and can be used to identify and remove substrings that match a certain pattern.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Removing Vowels from a String**: Given a string, remove all vowels from it. The solution involves iterating through the string and checking if each character is a vowel. If it is, it's not included in the result string.\n\n2. **String Transformation**: Given a string, transform it by removing certain characters or replacing them with others based on specific rules. This can involve using string methods or regex to match and manipulate the string according to the rules.\n\n3. **CamelCase to Snake_case**: Convert a string from CamelCase to snake_case.

The syntax is `[expression for item in iterable if condition]`. For example, to filter odd numbers from a list, you can use the following list comprehension:\n```python\nodd_numbers = [x for x in numbers if x % 2 != 0]\n```\n\n### `filter()` Function:\nThe `filter()` function in Python takes two arguments: a function and an iterable. The function is applied to each item of the iterable, and `filter()` returns an iterator that contains only the items for which the function returns `True`. To get a list of odd numbers, you can use `filter()` like this:\n```python\nodd_numbers = list(filter(lambda x: x % 2 != 0, numbers))\n```\n\n### For-Loop with Conditional Statements:\nYou can also use a for-loop with an `if` statement to filter items. This is a more verbose method but can be more readable for beginners:\n```python\nodd_numbers = []\nfor x in numbers:\n    if x % 2 != 0:\n        odd_numbers.append(x)\n```\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Filtering Prime Numbers**: Given a list of integers, return a list containing only the prime numbers.\n   - Solution: Iterate over the list and use a function to check if each number is prime.

However, to understand the underlying concept, let's consider how you might implement this manually.\n\nPython strings are immutable, meaning you cannot change them in place. Therefore, you will need to create a new string with the toggled case characters. You can do this by iterating over each character in the input string and checking if it is uppercase or lowercase. Python provides the `str.isupper()` and `str.islower()` methods to check the case of a character.\n\nHere's a step-by-step approach to manually toggle the case of a string:\n1. Initialize an empty string to store the result.\n2. Iterate over each character in the input string.\n3. For each character, check if it is uppercase or lowercase.\n4. If it is uppercase, convert it to lowercase using `str.lower()`.\n5. If it is lowercase, convert it to uppercase using `str.upper()`.\n6. Append the toggled character to the result string.\n7. Return the result string after the loop completes.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **String Transformation**: Given a string, transform it by toggling the case of each letter and then reversing the entire string.

The solution involves converting both the string and the substring to the same case (either upper or lower) using `str.lower()` or `str.upper()` and then using the `str.count()` method.\n\n3. **Alphabet Rangoli**: Given an integer `n`, print an alphabet rangoli of size `n`. An alphabet rangoli is a pattern where characters from the English alphabet are displayed in a particular pattern.

The algorithm involves the following steps:\n1. Convert the integers to strings to easily access individual digits.\n2. Pad the shorter string with leading zeros to match the length of the longer string.\n3. Iterate over the digits of both strings simultaneously, calculate the absolute difference between the corresponding digits, and sum these differences.\n\n## Tutorial:\nTo solve problems like the one given, you need to understand how to perform operations on individual digits of an integer. In Python, this is often done by converting the integer to a string. Here's a step-by-step guide:\n\n1. **Convert Integers to Strings**: Use the `str()` function to convert an integer to a string.\n   ```python\n   num_str = str(1234)  # num_str is now \"1234\"\n   ```\n\n2. **Access Individual Digits**: Once you have a string representation of the number, you can access each digit using indexing.\n   ```python\n   first_digit = num_str[0]  # first_digit is now \"1\"\n   ```\n\n3. **Pad Strings with Zeros**: If the numbers have different lengths, you can pad the shorter one with zeros using the `zfill()` method.\n   ```python\n   shorter_str = \"123\".zfill(4)  # shorter_str is now \"0123\"\n   ```\n\n4. **Calculate Absolute Differences**: Use a loop to iterate over the digits and calculate the absolute difference using the `abs()` function.\n   ```python\n   abs_diff = abs(int(num_str[0]) - int(shorter_str[0]))  # abs_diff is now 1\n   ```\n\n5. **Sum the Differences**: Keep a running total of the differences as you iterate through the digits.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Adding Reversed Numbers**: Given two integers, reverse them and then add them. Finally, reverse the sum and return it.\n   - Solution: Convert the integers to strings, reverse the strings, convert back to integers, add them, and then reverse the sum.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def reverse_add(n1, n2):\n         reversed_sum = int(str(n1)[::-1]) + int(str(n2)[::-1])\n         return int(str(reversed_sum)[::-1])\n     ```\n\n2. **Equalize the Number Digits**: Given two integers, determine the minimum number of operations needed to make the number of digits equal by only being able to add 1 to either number.\n   - Solution: Compare the lengths of the string representations and increment the shorter number until the lengths match.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def equalize_digits(n1, n2):\n         operations = 0\n         while len(str(n1)) != len(str(n2)):\n             if len(str(n1)) < len(str(n2)):\n                 n1 += 1\n             else:\n                 n2 += 1\n             operations += 1\n         return operations\n     ```\n\n3. **Find the Difference in Binary Representation**: Given two integers, convert them to binary and find the number of bit positions where they differ.\n   - Solution: Convert the integers to binary strings, pad the shorter one with zeros, and count the differing bits.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def binary_difference(n1, n2):\n         bin1 = bin(n1)[2:]\n         bin2 = bin(n2)[2:]\n         max_len = max(len(bin1), len(bin2))\n         bin1 = bin1.zfill(max_len)\n         bin2 = bin2.zfill(max_len)\n         return sum(b1 != b2 for b1, b2 in zip(bin1, bin2))\n     ```\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n- Explanation of the solution:\n  The solution involves converting the integers to strings, padding the shorter string with zeros, iterating over the digits, calculating the absolute difference for each pair of digits, and summing these differences.\n\n- Python3 code to solve the problem:\n```python\ndef digit_distance_nums(n1: int, n2: int) -> int:\n    # Convert integers to strings\n    str_n1, str_n2 = str(n1), str(n2)\n    \n    # Pad the shorter string with zeros\n    max_len = max(len(str_n1), len(str_n2))\n    str_n1, str_n2 = str_n1.zfill(max_len), str_n2.zfill(max_len)\n    \n    # Calculate the sum of per-digit differences\n    sum_diff = sum(abs(int(d1) - int(d2)) for d1, d2 in zip(str_n1, str_n2))\n    \n    return sum_diff\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(digit_distance_nums(123, 256))  # Output: 6 (|1-2| + |2-5| + |3-6|)\n```"], "prompt_tokens": [207], "completion_tokens": [1031], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": false, "task_id": "mbpp_558_digit_distance_nums"}

This algorithm is used to find the largest sum contiguous subarray within a one-dimensional array of numbers.\n\n## Tutorial:\nKadane's Algorithm is an efficient way to solve the \"Maximum Subarray Problem,\" which is a classic problem in computer science. The algorithm scans the entire array and at each position, it decides whether to start a new subarray or to continue the existing subarray. The key insight is that any subarray with a negative sum will not contribute to a maximum subarray starting after it.\n\nHere's a step-by-step explanation of Kadane's Algorithm:\n1. Initialize two variables: `max_so_far` (the global maximum) and `max_ending_here` (the local maximum at the current position).\n2. Iterate over the array from the first element to the last.\n3. For each element, update `max_ending_here` by adding the current element to it.\n4. If `max_ending_here` becomes less than zero, reset it to zero (since we don't want to start a new subarray with a negative sum).\n5. Update `max_so_far` if `max_ending_here` is greater than `max_so_far`.\n6. Continue this process until the end of the array.\n7. The value of `max_so_far` at the end of the iteration is the maximum subarray sum.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Maximum Circular Subarray Sum**: This problem is a variation of the maximum subarray sum where the array is circular, meaning the end of the array wraps around to the beginning. The solution involves finding the maximum subarray sum using Kadane's Algorithm and the minimum subarray sum, then subtracting the minimum sum from the total sum of the array to account for the circular wrap-around.\n\n2. **Maximum Sum Rectangle in a 2D Matrix**: Given a 2D matrix, find the maximum sum of any rectangle within the matrix. This problem can be solved by applying Kadane's Algorithm on the sum of columns for different row combinations.\n\n3. **Maximum Product Subarray**: Similar to the maximum sum subarray, this problem asks for the maximum product of a contiguous subarray. The solution involves keeping track of the maximum and minimum products up to the current position, because a negative number can turn a minimum product into a maximum product when multiplied.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\nWe will implement Kadane's Algorithm to solve the given problem. We will iterate through the array while keeping track of the current subarray sum and the maximum subarray sum found so far.\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef max_sub_array_sum(a: List[int], size: int) -> int:\n    max_so_far = a[0]\n    max_ending_here = a[0]\n    \n    for i in range(1, size):\n        max_ending_here = max(a[i], max_ending_here + a[i])\n        max_so_far = max(max_so_far, max_ending_here)\n    \n    return max_so_far\n\n# Example usage:\narr = [-2, -3, 4, -1, -2, 1, 5, -3]\nprint(max_sub_array_sum(arr, len(arr)))  # Output: 7\n```\n\nIn the code above, `max_so_far` keeps track of the maximum sum we have found so far, and `max_ending_here` keeps track of the maximum sum of the subarray ending at the current position. We update `max_ending_here` by taking the maximum of the current element and the sum of `max_ending_here` plus the current element. If `max_ending_here` is greater than `max_so_far`, we update `max_so_far`. This process continues until we have gone through the entire array, and the final value of `max_so_far` is the maximum subarray sum."], "prompt_tokens": [212], "completion_tokens": [823], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": true, "task_id": "mbpp_559_max_sub_array_sum"}

The `set` data structure provides several methods, including:\n\n- `union()`: Returns a set that contains all items from the original set, and all items from the specified sets. You can specify as many sets you want, separated by commas. It can also be used with the `|` operator.\n- `add()`: Adds an element to the set.\n- `remove()`: Removes a specific element from the set.\n- `intersection()`: Returns a set that contains only items that exist in both sets.\n- `difference()`: Returns a set containing items in the first set but not in the second.\n\nTo solve the union problem, we can convert both lists to sets and then use the `union()` method or the `|` operator to combine them. After performing the union, we can convert the set back to a list and sort it before returning.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Intersection of Two Arrays**: Given two arrays, write a function to compute their intersection. The solution involves converting both arrays to sets and using the `intersection()` method, then returning the result as a list.\n\n2. **Unique Email Addresses**: Every email consists of a local name and a domain name, separated by the @ sign. A function is required to return the number of different addresses that actually receive mails after applying some operations like ignoring dots in the local name and ignoring everything after a plus sign. This can be solved by processing each email according to the rules and adding the processed emails to a set to keep them unique.\n\n3. **Distribute Candies**: Given an integer array with even length, where different numbers represent different kinds of candies. Each number means one candy of the corresponding kind. You need to distribute these candies equally in number to brother and sister.

Specifically, we need to count the number of unique pairs that can be formed from the list where the two elements in each pair are different. This is a straightforward application of combinatorial mathematics, where we are essentially looking for the number of 2-combinations (pairs) from a set, with the constraint that the elements must be distinct.\n\n## Tutorial:\nIn combinatorics, a combination is a selection of items from a collection, such that the order of selection does not matter. When we want to find the number of ways to select pairs from a set of `n` distinct items, we use the formula for combinations:\n\nC(n, 2) = n! / (2! * (n - 2)!)\n\nwhere `n!` denotes the factorial of `n`, which is the product of all positive integers up to `n`.\n\nHowever, in our problem, the elements of the pairs must be unequal. If the array contains duplicate elements, we need to adjust our approach to account for these. One way to do this is to count the frequency of each element in the array and then use the formula:\n\nTotal pairs = C(n, 2) - \u03a3 C(freq[i], 2)\n\nwhere `freq[i]` is the frequency of the `i`-th unique element in the array, and the summation runs over all unique elements. This formula subtracts the number of invalid pairs (where both elements are equal) from the total number of pairs.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Two Sum**: Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`. The solution involves using a hash map to store the elements and their indices, and then iterating through the array to check if the complement (`target - nums[i]`) exists in the map.\n\n2. **3Sum**: Given an array `nums` of `n` integers, are there elements `a`, `b`, `c` in `nums` such that `a + b + c = 0`? Find all unique triplets in the array which gives the sum of zero. The solution typically involves sorting the array and using two pointers to find the triplets.\n\n3. **Maximum Number of Pairs in Array**: You are given an integer array `nums`. In one operation, you can choose any two integers of the same value and remove them from the array. Return the maximum number of operations you can perform on the array. This problem can be solved by counting the frequency of each number and then summing up the integer division of each frequency by 2.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n```python\nfrom typing import List\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef count_Pairs(arr: List[int], n: int) -> int:\n    # Count the frequency of each element in the array\n    freq = Counter(arr)\n    \n    # Calculate the total number of pairs\n    total_pairs = n * (n - 1) // 2  # C(n, 2)\n    \n    # Subtract the number of invalid pairs (where both elements are equal)\n    for count in freq.values():\n        total_pairs -= count * (count - 1) // 2  # C(freq[i], 2)\n    \n    return total_pairs\n\n# Example usage:\narr = [1, 2, 3, 1, 2]\nn = len(arr)\nprint(count_Pairs(arr, n))  # Output should be 7\n```\n\n### Explanation of the solution:\nThe function `count_Pairs` first counts the frequency of each element in the array using the `Counter` class from the `collections` module. It then calculates the total number of pairs that can be formed from the array without any constraints using the combination formula C(n, 2). After that, it iterates over the frequency counts and subtracts the number of invalid pairs (where both elements are the same) for each unique element.

In Python, strings are treated as sequences of characters, which means we can perform operations that are common to all sequences, such as indexing, slicing, and iterating.\n\nTo split a string into characters, we can simply iterate over the string and collect each character.

Initialize a variable to store the sum of digits, often starting at 0.\n2. Use a loop to iterate through each digit of the number.

The algorithm proceeds by finding the smallest (or largest, depending on sorting order) element in the unsorted sublist, exchanging it with the leftmost unsorted element (putting it in sorted order), and moving the sublist boundaries one element to the right.\n\n4. **Merge Sort**: An efficient, general-purpose, comparison-based sorting algorithm. Most implementations produce a stable sort, meaning that the order of equal elements is the same in the input and output. Merge sort is a divide and conquer algorithm.\n\n5. **Quicksort**: A divide-and-conquer algorithm. It works by selecting a 'pivot' element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot.\n\n6. **Heapsort**: A comparison-based sorting algorithm. Heapsort can be thought of as an improved selection sort: like selection sort, heapsort divides its input into a sorted and an unsorted region, and it iteratively shrinks the unsorted region by extracting the largest element from it and inserting it into the sorted region.\n\nFor the problem at hand, we can use Python's built-in `sort()` method for lists, which is a highly optimized, in-place sorting algorithm that is efficient for most use cases.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Sorting a list of numbers**: Given a list of numbers, sort them in ascending order. This is a straightforward application of any sorting algorithm.\n\n2. **Sorting strings lexicographically**: Given a list of strings, sort them based on dictionary order. This can be done using the built-in `sort()` method in Python, which compares strings lexicographically by default.\n\n3. **Sorting by a custom comparator**: Sometimes, we need to sort based on a custom condition, such as sorting a list of tuples based on the second element. This can be achieved by passing a custom `key` function to the `sort()` method.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\nThe solution involves iterating over the list of lists and sorting each sublist in place. We can use the built-in `sort()` method for this purpose.\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef sort_sublists(list1: List[List[str]]) -> List[List[str]]:\n    # Iterate through each sublist in the list\n    for sublist in list1:\n        # Sort the sublist in place\n        sublist.sort()\n    # Return the list with sorted sublists\n    return list1\n\n# Example usage:\nlist_of_lists = [[\"banana\", \"apple\", \"cherry\"], [\"dog\", \"cat\", \"elephant\"]]\nsorted_list_of_lists = sort_sublists(list_of_lists)\nprint(sorted_list_of_lists)  # Output: [['apple', 'banana', 'cherry'], ['cat', 'dog', 'elephant']]\n```\n\nThe `sort()` method sorts the sublist in place, meaning that the original sublist is modified to be sorted rather than creating a new sorted list.

A common approach is to use a set or a dictionary to achieve this because they only store unique elements and have O(1) average time complexity for adding elements and checking for their existence.\n\n## Tutorial:\nSets and dictionaries in Python are implemented using a hash table. When you add an element to a set, it calculates the hash of the element and stores it in a bucket corresponding to that hash. This makes checking for the existence of an element very efficient.\n\nHere's a brief tutorial on how to use sets for our problem:\n\n1. Initialize an empty set.\n2. Iterate through each number in the list.\n3. For each number, check if it is already in the set.\n4. If it is not in the set, add it to the set.\n5. If it is in the set, remove it (since we want to remove duplicates).\n6. Convert the set back to a list and return it.\n\nThis algorithm ensures that each element is only present once in the set, effectively removing duplicates.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Single Number**: Given a non-empty array of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one. The solution involves using XOR operation on all elements. The property of XOR is that a^a=0 and a^0=a. So, all paired elements will cancel out, leaving the unique number.\n\n2. **Find All Duplicates in an Array**: Given an array of integers, some elements appear twice and others appear once. Find all the elements that appear twice in this array. The solution can involve using a set to track seen numbers or modifying the original array by negating the value at the index corresponding to the number.\n\n3. **Intersection of Two Arrays**: Given two arrays, write a function to compute their intersection. The solution involves using two sets, one for each array, and then finding the intersection of these sets.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\nWe will use a set to keep track of the numbers we have seen.

Base Case: Determine the simplest case which can be solved directly without further recursion. This prevents infinite recursion.\n2. Recursive Case: If the case is not the base case, break down the problem into smaller instances and call the function recursively.\n\nWhen dealing with nested tuples, the base case is typically when we reach an element that is not a tuple (or the nested structure we're dealing with).

Python provides a rich set of methods to work with strings, such as `find()`, `index()`, `split()`, and slicing.\n\nRegular expressions are a powerful tool for matching patterns within text. In Python, the `re` module provides regex functionality. A regex pattern defines a search pattern that can be used to find strings or substrings that match the pattern.\n\nTo find an adverb ending with \"ly\", we can use the following approaches:\n\n1. **String Methods**: Iterate through each word in the string and check if it ends with \"ly\" using the `endswith()` method. If it does, return the word and its position.\n\n2. **Regular Expressions**: Use the `re` module to search for a pattern that matches any word ending with \"ly\". The pattern could be something like `\\b\\w+ly\\b`, where `\\b` matches word boundaries, `\\w+` matches one or more word characters, and `ly` is the literal string we're looking for.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Finding All Occurrences of a Substring**: Given a string and a substring, find all the starting indices of the substring's occurrences in the string.\n   - Solution: Iterate through the string and use the `find()` method or regex `finditer()` to locate all occurrences.\n   - Python code:\n     ```python\n     import re\n\n     def find_all_substrings(text, pattern):\n         return [m.start() for m in re.finditer(pattern, text)]\n     ```\n\n2. **Validating Email Addresses**: Given a list of email addresses, write a function to filter out the invalid ones based on a pattern.\n   - Solution: Use regex to define a pattern for a valid email address and filter the list using the `match()` or `search()` methods.\n   - Python code:\n     ```python\n     import re\n\n     def validate_emails(emails):\n         pattern = r'^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$'\n         return [email for email in emails if re.match(pattern, email)]\n     ```\n\n3. **Extracting Dates from Text**: Given a string containing dates in the format \"dd/mm/yyyy\", extract all the dates.\n   - Solution: Use regex to define a pattern that matches the date format and extract all occurrences.\n   - Python code:\n     ```python\n     import re\n\n     def extract_dates(text):\n         pattern = r'\\b\\d{2}/\\d{2}/\\d{4}\\b'\n         return re.findall(pattern, text)\n     ```\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n- Explanation of the solution:\n  We will use regular expressions to find the first adverb ending with \"ly\". The regex pattern will look for a word boundary, followed by one or more word characters, followed by \"ly\", and another word boundary. We will use the `search()` method to find the first match and return the word along with its starting and ending positions.\n\n- Python3 code to solve the problem:\n  ```python\n  import re\n\n  def find_adverbs(text: str) -> str:\n      \"\"\"\n      Write a function to find the first adverb ending with ly and its positions in a given string.\n      \"\"\"\n      pattern = r'\\b(\\w+ly)\\b'\n      match = re.search(pattern, text)\n      if match:\n          adverb = match.group(1)\n          start_pos = match.start()\n          end_pos = match.end() - 1  # Subtract 1 to get the last index of the word itself\n          return f\"{adverb} {start_pos} {end_pos}\"\n      else:\n          return \"No adverb ending with 'ly' found.\"\n\n  # Example usage:\n  text_input = \"He was running incredibly quickly towards the finish line.\"\n  print(find_adverbs(text_input))  # Output: \"incredibly 14 23\"\n  ```"], "prompt_tokens": [204], "completion_tokens": [881], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": false, "task_id": "mbpp_584_find_adverbs"}

We need to sort the items based on their price in descending order to find the n most expensive items. Sorting is a fundamental algorithm in computer science and is used in a wide range of applications.\n\n## Tutorial:\nSorting algorithms are techniques that put elements of a list in a certain order. The most frequently used orders are numerical and lexicographical order. Efficient sorting is important for optimizing the efficiency of other algorithms (such as search and merge algorithms) that require input data in sorted lists.\n\nThere are several sorting algorithms, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. Some of the most common sorting algorithms include:\n\n1. **Bubble Sort**: A simple comparison-based algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted.\n\n2. **Selection Sort**: This algorithm divides the input list into two parts: a sorted sublist of items which is built up from left to right at the front (left) of the list, and a sublist of the remaining unsorted items. The algorithm proceeds by finding the smallest (or largest, depending on sorting order) element in the unsorted sublist, exchanging it with the leftmost unsorted element, and moving the sublist boundaries one element to the right.\n\n3. **Insertion Sort**: It builds the final sorted array one item at a time. It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort.\n\n4. **Merge Sort**: A divide and conquer algorithm that divides the input array into two halves, calls itself for the two halves, and then merges the two sorted halves.\n\n5. **Quicksort**: A divide and conquer algorithm. It works by selecting a 'pivot' element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot.\n\n6. **Heapsort**: A comparison-based sorting algorithm that uses a binary heap data structure. It starts by building a heap out of the data set, and then repeatedly extracts the largest element from the heap and reconstructs the heap.\n\nFor the given problem, we can use Python's built-in sorting function, which is highly optimized and easy to use.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Kth Largest Element in an Array**: Find the kth largest element in an unsorted array. This problem can be solved by sorting the array and then accessing the element at the index `len(array) - k`.\n\n2. **Merge Intervals**: Given a collection of intervals, merge all overlapping intervals. This problem involves sorting the intervals based on their start times and then merging overlapping intervals.\n\n3. **Meeting Rooms II**: Given an array of meeting time intervals consisting of start and end times, find the minimum number of conference rooms required. This problem can be approached by sorting the intervals by start time and using a min-heap to track the end time of meetings.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\nTo solve the original problem, we will sort the list of items based on their price in descending order and then return the first n items from the sorted list.\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List, Dict, Union\n\ndef expensive_items(items: List[Dict[str, Union[str, float]]], n: int) -> List[Dict[str, Union[str, float]]]:\n    # Sort the items by price in descending order\n    sorted_items = sorted(items, key=lambda x: x['price'], reverse=True)\n    # Return the first n items from the sorted list\n    return sorted_items[:n]\n\n# Example usage:\nitems = [\n    {\"name\": \"Laptop\", \"price\": 1200.0},\n    {\"name\": \"Smartphone\", \"price\": 800.0},\n    {\"name\": \"Headphones\", \"price\": 150.0},\n    {\"name\": \"Monitor\", \"price\": 300.0},\n    {\"name\": \"Keyboard\", \"price\": 100.0}\n]\n\nprint(expensive_items(items, 2))\n# Output should be:\n# [{'name': 'Laptop', 'price': 1200.0}, {'name': 'Smartphone', 'price': 800.0}]\n```\n\nIn this code, we use the `sorted` function with a lambda function as the key argument to sort the items by their 'price' in descending order.

Array slicing is a technique that allows us to get a subset of elements from an array (or list in Python) by specifying the start and end indices. In this problem, we will use slicing to split the array into two parts and then concatenate them in reverse order.\n\n## Tutorial:\nArray slicing in Python can be done using the colon `:` operator inside square brackets. The general syntax for slicing is `array[start:stop:step]`, where `start` is the index to begin the slice, `stop` is the index to end the slice, and `step` is the interval between elements in the slice. If `step` is omitted, it defaults to 1. If `start` or `stop` is omitted, it defaults to the beginning or end of the array, respectively.\n\nHere's a quick rundown of how slicing works:\n- `array[:n]` will return the first `n` elements of the array.\n- `array[n:]` will return the array from the `n`-th element to the end.\n- `array[-n:]` will return the last `n` elements of the array.\n- `array[:-n]` will return the array except for the last `n` elements.\n\nIn the context of the given problem, we will use slicing to split the array into two parts: from the beginning to the `n`-th element, and from the `n`-th element to the end. Then, we will concatenate the second part to the first part to achieve the desired result.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Rotate Array**: Given an array, rotate the array to the right by `k` steps, where `k` is non-negative.\n   Solution: This can be solved by slicing the array into two parts: one from the beginning to the length minus `k`, and the other from length minus `k` to the end. Then, concatenate the second part to the first part.\n   \n2. **Rearrange Array**: Given an array of integers, rearrange the array in such a way that the first element is first maximum and the second element is the first minimum, and so on.\n   Solution: Sort the array and then use two pointers to pick elements from the start and end of the sorted array, alternatively adding them to a new array.\n\n3. **Shuffle the Array**: Given the array `nums` consisting of `2n` elements in the form `[x1,x2,...,xn,y1,y2,...,yn]`, return the array in the form `[x1,y1,x2,y2,...,xn,yn]`.\n   Solution: Use slicing to separate the array into two parts, `x` and `y`, and then interleave them using a loop or list comprehension.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\nTo solve the original problem, we will use array slicing to split the list into two parts at the `n`-th element.

If it's not an integer, round up to the nearest integer. This will be our starting point.\n2. Find the square root of the ending number `b`. If it's not an integer, round down to the nearest integer.

The solution involves iterating through the range and checking if each number is prime, which can be done by checking divisibility up to the square root of the number.\n\n2. **Sum of Fibonacci Numbers**: Given a number `n`, find the sum of all Fibonacci numbers less than or equal to `n`. The solution involves generating Fibonacci numbers and adding them until the next Fibonacci number would exceed `n`.\n\n3. **Finding Pythagorean Triplets**: Given a number `n`, find all Pythagorean triplets (a, b, c) such that a^2 + b^2 = c^2 and a, b, c are less than `n`.

The idea is to iterate through both strings and count the number of mismatches at each position. Since we are dealing with binary numbers, a mismatch occurs when one string has a '0' and the other has a '1' at the same position. To convert one binary number to another, we need to swap mismatched bits. However, we can only swap bits at the same index, so we need to find pairs of indices where the bits are mismatched and swap them.\n\n## Tutorial:\nTo solve this problem, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialize a counter to keep track of the minimum number of swaps.\n2. Iterate through both strings simultaneously and compare the bits at each index.\n3. If there is a mismatch (one string has '0' and the other has '1'), increment the counter.\n4. After the loop, the counter will represent the total number of mismatches.\n5. Since each swap can fix two mismatches, the minimum number of swaps required is half the number of mismatches. However, if the number of mismatches is odd, it means that it's impossible to make the strings equal with swaps alone, and we should return -1 or some indication of impossibility.\n\nNote that this algorithm assumes that the number of '0's and '1's in both strings is the same. If the counts are different, it's impossible to make the strings equal by swapping bits.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Minimum Swaps to Make Sequences Increasing**: You are given two sequences of integers, and you want to make both sequences strictly increasing by swapping elements between the two sequences. The problem can be solved using dynamic programming or a greedy approach.\n\n2. **Minimum Swaps to Group All 1's Together**: Given a binary array, you need to find the minimum number of swaps required to bring all the 1's together in the array. This can be solved using a sliding window approach.\n\n3. **Minimum Adjacent Swaps to Reach the Kth Smallest Number**: Given a string representing a number and an integer `k`, find the minimum number of adjacent swaps required to get the kth smallest number possible by only swapping adjacent digits. This problem can be solved using a combination of math to find the kth permutation and a greedy approach to count the swaps.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\nWe will iterate through both strings and count the number of '0' to '1' and '1' to '0' mismatches.

However, since we are only interested in the kth element, we do not need to merge the entire arrays, which would result in unnecessary computations. Instead, we can iterate through both arrays, keeping track of the count of elements until we reach the kth element.\n\n## Tutorial:\nThe Merge Sort algorithm is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that consists of two main parts: dividing the array into halves and merging the sorted halves. The merging step involves comparing the elements of the two halves and combining them into a single sorted array.\n\nTo find the kth element in two sorted arrays, we can simulate the merge process without actually creating the merged array. We maintain two pointers, one for each array, and move the pointer that points to the smaller element forward, effectively \"merging\" the arrays in a virtual sense. We keep a counter to track how many elements we have seen so far. When the counter reaches k, we have found our kth element.\n\nHere's a step-by-step approach:\n1. Initialize two pointers, `i` and `j`, to point to the beginning of `arr1` and `arr2`, respectively.\n2. Initialize a counter `count` to 0.\n3. While `count` is less than `k`, do the following:\n   a. Compare `arr1[i]` and `arr2[j]`.\n   b. If `arr1[i]` is smaller or `j` is out of bounds, increment `i` and `count`.\n   c. Otherwise, increment `j` and `count`.\n4. When `count` equals `k`, return the last element selected.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Merge Two Sorted Lists**: Given two sorted linked lists, merge them so that the resulting linked list is also sorted.\n   Solution: Similar to merging two sorted arrays, we would iterate through both lists, always choosing the smaller node and attaching it to the merged list, until one list is exhausted. Then, attach the remaining elements of the non-exhausted list to the merged list.\n\n2. **Median of Two Sorted Arrays**: Given two sorted arrays, find the median of the combined sorted array.\n   Solution: The median is the middle element, so this problem can be solved by finding the kth element where k is the half of the combined length of the two arrays. If the combined length is even, we need to find the average of the two middle elements.\n\n3. **Kth Largest Element in an Array**: Find the kth largest element in an unsorted array.\n   Solution: This problem can be solved using a sorting algorithm and then accessing the element at the appropriate index.

When `count` reaches `k`, the function returns the element at the current pointer. If one array is exhausted, the function continues with the other array until the kth element is found.

The most common data structures used for this purpose are:\n\n1. **Hash Set**: A hash set is a data structure that stores unique elements and provides constant time complexity O(1) for adding elements and checking if an element is present in the set.\n\n2. **Hash Map (or Dictionary in Python)**: A hash map is a data structure that stores key-value pairs. It can also be used to keep track of the count of each character as we iterate through the string.\n\nFor this problem, we can use a hash set because we only need to know if we have seen a character before, not the number of times it has appeared.\n\n## Tutorial:\n### Hash Set:\nA hash set is a collection of items where each item is unique. In Python, this is implemented as the `set` data type. The primary operations on a set are adding elements and checking for membership, both of which can be done in O(1) average time complexity.\n\nHere's how you can use a set in Python:\n```python\nmy_set = set()  # Create an empty set\nmy_set.add('a')  # Add an element to the set\nif 'a' in my_set:  # Check if an element is in the set\n    print('Element is in the set')\n```\n\n### Hash Map (Dictionary):\nA hash map stores key-value pairs and allows for fast retrieval of values based on keys. In Python, dictionaries are implemented as hash maps.\n\nHere's a basic usage of a dictionary in Python:\n```python\nmy_dict = {}  # Create an empty dictionary\nmy_dict['a'] = 1  # Add a key-value pair to the dictionary\nif 'a' in my_dict:  # Check if a key is in the dictionary\n    print('Key is in the dictionary')\n```\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Finding Duplicate Elements**: Given an array of integers, find if the array contains any duplicates. Your function should return true if any value appears at least twice in the array, and it should return false if every element is distinct.\n\n   Solution: Use a hash set to keep track of the elements you've seen. Iterate through the array, and for each element, check if it's already in the set. If it is, return true; otherwise, add it to the set.\n\n2. **Two Sum Problem**: Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`.\n\n   Solution: Use a hash map to store the complement of each element (i.e., `target - nums[i]`) and its index. As you iterate through the array, check if the current element is in the hash map. If it is, you've found the two numbers that add up to the target.\n\n3. **Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters**: Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.\n\n   Solution: Use a hash map to store the last index of each character encountered. Use two pointers to define the window of the current substring. Move the right pointer to expand the window and update the hash map. If a character is found that is already in the hash map, move the left pointer to the right of the last index of this character.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\nWe will use a hash set to keep track of the characters we have seen. We will iterate through each character of the string, and for each character, we will check if it is already in the set. If it is, that means we have found the first repeated character, and we return it. If it is not, we add the character to the set.

In Python, strings are immutable, meaning they cannot be changed after they are created. However, we can create new strings based on operations performed on the original string.\n\nTo split a string into a list of words, we use the `split()` method, which divides a string into a list where each word is a list item. The default separator is any whitespace.\n\nReversing a list can be done using the `reverse()` method or by slicing with `[::-1]`. The slicing method is more concise and is often preferred in Pythonic code.\n\nFinally, to join the list of words back into a string, we use the `join()` method, which concatenates the elements of the list, inserting a specified separator between each element (in this case, a space).\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Palindrome Check**: Given a string, write a function to check if it is a palindrome by considering only alphanumeric characters and ignoring cases.\n   - Solution: Normalize the string by removing non-alphanumeric characters and converting to lower case.

This algorithm involves checking if the given number has any divisors other than 1 and itself.\n\n## Tutorial:\nA prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. The simplest method to check if a number is prime is to try dividing it by all numbers less than itself and greater than 1. If any of these divisions result in a whole number, then the number is not prime.\n\nHowever, we can optimize this process. We only need to check for divisors up to the square root of the number. This is because if `n` is divisible by some number `a`, then `n = a * b`, and if both `a` and `b` were greater than the square root of `n`, then `a * b` would be greater than `n`. So at least one of those factors must be less than or equal to the square root of `n`, and if we can't find any factors less than or equal to the square root, `n` must be prime.\n\nThe trial division algorithm can be further optimized by observing that all primes are of the form 6k \u00b1 1, with the exception of 2 and 3. This is because all integers can be expressed as (6k + i) for some integer k and for i = \u22121, 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4; 2 divides (6k + 0), (6k + 2), (6k + 4); and 3 divides (6k + 3). So a more efficient trial division checks if `n` is divisible by 2 or 3, then checks for divisors of the form 6k \u00b1 1.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Sieve of Eratosthenes**: Given a number `n`, list all prime numbers up to `n`. The solution involves creating a boolean array of size `n+1` and marking multiples of each prime number as not prime.\n\n2. **Prime Factorization**: Given a number `n`, find all prime factors of `n`. The solution involves dividing `n` by each prime number up to the square root of `n` and recording the factors.\n\n3. **Counting Primes**: Given two numbers `a` and `b`, count the number of prime numbers between `a` and `b`.

Then it will check if `num` is 2 or 3, which are prime. For other numbers, it will check divisibility by 2 and 3 to quickly eliminate multiples of these numbers.

Regular expressions are a powerful tool for matching patterns within text. In Python, the `re` module provides a set of functions that allows us to search, split, and manipulate strings based on regex patterns.\n\n## Tutorial:\nRegular expressions are sequences of characters that define a search pattern. They are commonly used for string searching and manipulation. Here are some basic components of regex:\n\n- **Literals**: These are the actual characters that will be matched directly.\n- **Metacharacters**: Characters with special meanings, such as:\n  - `.` (dot): Matches any single character except newline.\n  - `^`: Matches the start of the string.\n  - `$`: Matches the end of the string.\n  - `*`: Matches 0 or more repetitions of the preceding element.\n  - `+`: Matches 1 or more repetitions of the preceding element.\n  - `?`: Matches 0 or 1 repetition of the preceding element.\n  - `{m,n}`: Matches between m and n repetitions of the preceding element.\n  - `[...]`: Matches any single character in brackets.\n  - `|`: Acts like an OR operator.\n  - `(...)`: Groups together the expressions contained inside.\n- **Escape sequences**: To match metacharacters as literals, you need to escape them with a backslash (`\\`).\n\nIn Python, to use regex, you typically compile a pattern using `re.compile()` and then use methods like `match()`, `search()`, `findall()`, and `sub()` to find or replace text.\n\nHere's a quick example of using regex in Python:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\npattern = re.compile(r'\\d+')  # Matches one or more digits\ntext = \"There are 123 apples and 45 bananas.\"\n\n# Find all matches\nmatches = pattern.findall(text)\nprint(matches)  # Output: ['123', '45']\n```\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Email Address Finder**: Given a large text, find all valid email addresses.\n   - Solution: Use a regex pattern that matches the general structure of email addresses.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     import re\n\n     def find_emails(text):\n         pattern = re.compile(r'\\b[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\\.[A-Z|a-z]{2,}\\b')\n         return pattern.findall(text)\n     ```\n\n2. **Phone Number Validator**: Given a string, check if it is a valid phone number.\n   - Solution: Define a regex pattern that matches the format of phone numbers.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     import re\n\n     def validate_phone_number(number):\n         pattern = re.compile(r'^(?:\\+?44)?[07]\\d{9,13}$')\n         return bool(pattern.match(number))\n     ```\n\n3. **HTML Tag Extractor**: Given a string of HTML, extract all the tags.\n   - Solution: Use a regex pattern to match text enclosed in angle brackets.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     import re\n\n     def extract_html_tags(html):\n         pattern = re.compile(r'<[^>]+>')\n         return pattern.findall(html)\n     ```\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n- Explanation of the solution:\n  We will use the `re.search()` function from the `re` module to find the first occurrence of the pattern in the text. The `search()` function returns a match object if the pattern is found, and from this object, we can extract the matching substring as well as the start and end indices.\n\n- Python3 code to solve the problem:\n  ```python\n  import re\n  from typing import Tuple\n\n  def find_literals(text: str, pattern: str) -> Tuple[str, int, int]:\n      # Compile the regex pattern\n      regex = re.compile(pattern)\n      # Search for the pattern in the text\n      match = regex.search(text)\n      # If a match is found, return the substring and indices\n      if match:\n          return (match.group(), match.start(), match.end())\n      # If no match is found, return an empty string and -1 for indices\n      return (\"\", -1, -1)\n\n  # Example usage:\n  result = find_literals(\"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\", r\"brown\")\n  print(result)  # Output: ('brown', 10, 15)\n  ```\nThis function will return a tuple containing the matching substring and the start and end indices of the match within the original text. If no match is found, it will return an empty string and -1 for both indices."], "prompt_tokens": [226], "completion_tokens": [978], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": false, "task_id": "mbpp_607_find_literals"}

Bell numbers count the possible partitions of a set. The Bell number B(n) is the number of ways to partition a set of n elements. The Bell numbers can be computed using the Bell triangle, which is similar to Pascal's triangle.\n\n## Tutorial:\nDynamic programming is a method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems. It is applicable when the problem can be divided into overlapping subproblems that can be solved independently.\n\nFor Bell numbers, we can use dynamic programming to build a Bell triangle, where the nth row represents the nth Bell number. The Bell triangle can be constructed as follows:\n\n1. The first element of a row is the last element of the previous row.\n2. Each subsequent element is the sum of the previous element in the same row and the element directly above the previous element.\n\nHere's how the first few rows of the Bell triangle look:\n\n```\n1\n1 2\n2 3 5\n5 7 10 15\n...\n```\n\nThe Bell numbers are the sum of the numbers in the previous row (which is also the first element of the current row).\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Partition a Set into K Subsets**: Given a set of n elements, count the number of ways to partition it into exactly k non-empty subsets. This problem can be solved using dynamic programming by building a table where the entry dp[i][j] represents the number of ways to partition a set of i elements into j subsets.\n\n2. **Stirling Numbers of the Second Kind**: Stirling numbers of the second kind, denoted S(n, k), count the number of ways to partition a set of n elements into k non-empty subsets. This is closely related to Bell numbers, and dynamic programming can be used to compute these numbers in a similar manner.\n\n3. **Integer Partitions**: Given a positive integer n, find the number of ways to write n as a sum of positive integers, where the order of addends does not matter. This is another partition problem that can be solved using dynamic programming by building a table to store the counts of partitions for smaller values.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\nTo find the nth Bell number, we will use dynamic programming to construct the Bell triangle up to the nth row. The first element of each row is the last element of the previous row, and each subsequent element is computed as described above.\n\nHere's the Python3 code to solve the problem:\n\n```python\ndef bell_Number(n: int) -> int:\n    # Base case: the 0th Bell number is 1\n    if n == 0:\n        return 1\n    \n    # Initialize the Bell triangle with the first row\n    bell_triangle = [[1]]\n    \n    # Build the Bell triangle row by row\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        # Create a new row with the first element as the last element of the previous row\n        row = [bell_triangle[i - 1][-1]]\n        \n        # Compute the rest of the row\n        for j in range(1, i + 1):\n            row.append(row[j - 1] + bell_triangle[i - 1][j - 1] if j < len(bell_triangle[i - 1]) else row[j - 1])\n        \n        # Append the computed row to the Bell triangle\n        bell_triangle.append(row)\n    \n    # The nth Bell number is the first element of the nth row\n    return bell_triangle[n][0]\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(bell_Number(5))  # Output: 52\n```\n\nThis code will correctly compute the nth Bell number by constructing the Bell triangle up to the required row and then returning the first element of that row."], "prompt_tokens": [193], "completion_tokens": [795], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": false, "task_id": "mbpp_608_bell_Number"}

In Python, lists are mutable, which means we can change their contents without creating a new list. To remove an element at a specific index, we can use either the `del` statement or the `pop()` method.\n\n## Tutorial:\n### Using `del` statement:\nThe `del` statement is used to delete objects in Python. When it comes to lists, you can use `del` to remove an item at a specific index. For example, `del list[index]` will remove the item at the given index from the list.\n\n### Using `pop()` method:\nThe `pop()` method removes an item at the given index from the list and returns it. If no index is specified, `pop()` removes and returns the last item in the list. For example, `list.pop(index)` will remove and return the item at the given index.\n\n### Important points to consider:\n- List indices start at 0, so the k'th element is at index k-1.\n- Make sure the index k is within the bounds of the list to avoid `IndexError`.\n- Removing an element from a list does not require a separate algorithm; it's a built-in operation in Python.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Removing duplicates from a list**: Given a list of integers, remove all duplicates from the list.\n   - Solution: Iterate through the list and keep track of seen elements using a set.

We can use the `pop()` method to do this. We should also check if k is within the bounds of the list to avoid `IndexError`.\n\n- Python3 code:\n  ```python\n  def remove_kth_element(list1: List[int], k: int) -> List[int]:\n      # Check if k is within the bounds of the list\n      if 0 < k <= len(list1):\n          # Remove the k-1 index element\n          list1.pop(k-1)\n      return list1\n  ```\n\nIn the above code, we first check if `k` is a valid index for the list.

A two-dimensional array can be thought of as a list of lists, where each inner list represents a row in the matrix. To access a specific column in each row, you use the column index.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide to solving the problem:\n\n1. Initialize a variable to store the maximum value. You can start with a very small number or the first element of the Nth column.\n2. Loop through each row (inner list) of the matrix.\n3.

For this specific problem, we can use list comprehension, which is a concise way to create lists. The idea is to iterate over each element in the input list and extract the first and second elements of each sublist.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide to the process:\n1. Initialize two empty lists, one for the first elements and one for the second elements.\n2. Iterate over the input list of lists.\n3. For each sublist, append the first element to the first list and the second element to the second list.\n4. Return a list containing the two lists.\n\nAlternatively, we can achieve the same result using the `zip` function, which pairs up the elements of the given iterables.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Transpose of a Matrix**: Given a matrix represented as a list of lists, return its transpose. The transpose of a matrix is obtained by flipping the matrix over its diagonal, switching the row and column indices of the matrix.\n   - Solution: Iterate over the rows and columns, swapping the elements.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def transpose(matrix):\n         return list(map(list, zip(*matrix)))\n     ```\n\n2. **Unzip a List of Pairs**: Given a list of pairs, separate them into two lists.\n   - Solution: Similar to the original problem, use list comprehension or the `zip` function.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def unzip(pairs):\n         return list(zip(*pairs))\n     ```\n\n3. **Grouping Data**: Given a list of tuples where each tuple contains a key and a value, group the values by their keys.\n   - Solution: Use a dictionary to collect values by keys, then extract the grouped data.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     from collections import defaultdict\n\n     def group_by_key(data):\n         grouped = defaultdict(list)\n         for key, value in data:\n             grouped[key].append(value)\n         return dict(grouped)\n     ```\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n- Explanation of the solution:\n  We will use list comprehension to iterate over the input list `lst`.

The algorithm involves iterating over each list within the outer list and then iterating over each element within the inner lists to calculate the cumulative sum.\n\n## Tutorial:\nIterating through nested lists is a common task in programming. In Python, a list can contain other lists, which are referred to as nested lists or two-dimensional arrays. To iterate through a nested list, you typically use a nested loop. The outer loop iterates through the outer list, and the inner loop iterates through each inner list.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide to iterating through a nested list and calculating the cumulative sum:\n\n1. Initialize a variable to store the cumulative sum.\n2. Use a for loop to iterate through the outer list.\n3. Inside the outer loop, use another for loop to iterate through each inner list.\n4. For each element in the inner list, add its value to the cumulative sum.\n5. After all iterations, return the cumulative sum.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Matrix Diagonal Sum**: Given a square matrix (2D list), calculate the sum of the matrix diagonals. Only include each element once if it's part of both diagonals.\n   - Solution: Iterate through the matrix, adding elements from the primary and secondary diagonals to the sum. Be careful to not double-count the center element in the case of an odd-dimension matrix.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def diagonalSum(mat):\n         n = len(mat)\n         total = 0\n         for i in range(n):\n             total += mat[i][i]  # Primary diagonal\n             total += mat[i][n - 1 - i]  # Secondary diagonal\n         if n % 2 == 1:\n             total -= mat[n // 2][n // 2]  # Subtract the center element if it was counted twice\n         return total\n     ```\n\n2. **Flatten Nested List**: Given a nested list of integers, flatten it into a single list with all the integers in the order they appeared.\n   - Solution: Use a recursive function to iterate through each element. If the element is a list, recursively flatten it; otherwise, add the integer to the flattened list.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def flatten(nested_list):\n         result = []\n         for element in nested_list:\n             if isinstance(element, list):\n                 result.extend(flatten(element))\n             else:\n                 result.append(element)\n         return result\n     ```\n\n3. **Maximum Path Sum in a Triangle**: Given a triangle represented as a nested list where each list contains integers that are adjacent in the row above, find the maximum path sum from top to bottom.\n   - Solution: Use dynamic programming to iterate from the bottom of the triangle upwards, updating each element to be the sum of itself and the maximum of the two elements directly below it.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def maxPathSum(triangle):\n         for row in range(len(triangle) - 2, -1, -1):\n             for col in range(len(triangle[row])):\n                 triangle[row][col] += max(triangle[row + 1][col], triangle[row + 1][col + 1])\n         return triangle[0][0]\n     ```\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n- Explanation of the solution:\n  The solution involves iterating through each list within the given list of lists and then iterating through each integer within those lists.

This can be solved using a greedy approach if the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the step sizes is 1. If the GCD is greater than 1, we can only reach multiples of the GCD. If `d` is not a multiple of the GCD, the problem has no solution.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Coin Change Problem**: Given an unlimited supply of coins of given denominations, find the minimum number of coins required to make a certain amount of money.\n2. **Frog Jump**: A frog can jump either 1, 2, or 3 steps at a time. Find the number of ways the frog can reach the nth step.\n3. **Minimum Path Sum in a Triangle**: Given a triangle, find the minimum path sum from top to bottom. At each step, you may move to an adjacent number of the row below.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n- Explanation of the solution:\nTo solve the original problem, we can use a greedy approach. We will try to make the largest jumps possible first and then use the smaller jump to cover the remaining distance. If the GCD of the two steps is 1, we can always reach the point `(d, 0)` by some combination of the two jumps. If the GCD is greater than 1, we check if `d` is a multiple of the GCD. If it is not, the problem has no solution.\n\n- Python3 code to solve the problem:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import Tuple\nfrom math import gcd\n\ndef min_Jumps(steps: Tuple[int, int], d: int) -> float:\n    step1, step2 = steps\n    # Find the GCD of the two steps\n    step_gcd = gcd(step1, step2)\n    \n    # If d is not a multiple of the GCD, we cannot reach the point (d, 0)\n    if d % step_gcd != 0:\n        return float('inf')\n    \n    # Use the larger step as much as possible\n    max_step = max(step1, step2)\n    min_step = min(step1, step2)\n    \n    # Number of jumps using the larger step\n    max_step_jumps = d // max_step\n    \n    # Remaining distance to cover using the smaller step\n    remaining_distance = d % max_step\n    \n    # If the remaining distance is 0, we do not need the smaller step\n    if remaining_distance == 0:\n        return max_step_jumps\n    \n    # Otherwise, we need one additional jump of the smaller step\n    return max_step_jumps + 1\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(min_Jumps((2, 3), 7))  # Output: 3 (2 jumps of 3 and 1 jump of 2)\n```\n\nIn this code, we first check if the problem is solvable by checking the GCD of the step sizes. Then we use the larger step as much as possible and use the smaller step if needed. The function returns the minimum number of jumps required to reach or surpass the distance `d`. If the problem is not solvable, it returns infinity (`float('inf')`)."], "prompt_tokens": [231], "completion_tokens": [883], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": true, "task_id": "mbpp_617_min_Jumps"}

For each pair of elements, we will perform division. We need to handle the case where an element in `nums2` is zero to avoid a division by zero error. We can either skip the division or handle it in a specific way, such as returning `float('inf')` or some error value.\n\n- Python3 code to solve the problem:\n  ```python\n  def div_list(nums1: List[int], nums2: List[int]) -> List[float]:\n      \"\"\"\n      Write a function to divide two lists element wise.\n      \"\"\"\n      result = []\n      for a, b in zip(nums1, nums2):\n          if b == 0:\n              result.append(float('inf'))  # or handle division by zero as needed\n          else:\n              result.append(a / b)\n      return result\n  ```\n\nIn the provided code, we append `float('inf')` when we encounter a division by zero.

The binary search algorithm is efficient for this problem because it allows us to find the median in logarithmic time complexity by repeatedly dividing the search space in half.\n\n## Tutorial:\nThe binary search algorithm is a search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array. It compares the target value to the middle element of the array; if they are not equal, the half in which the target cannot lie is eliminated, and the search continues on the remaining half until the target value is found or the remaining search space is empty.\n\nFor finding the median of two sorted arrays, the binary search algorithm can be applied in the following way:\n1. Find the middle element of the first array and the corresponding element in the second array such that the number of elements less than or equal to both is equal to the number of elements greater than or equal to both.\n2.

We will perform the binary search on the smaller array and try to partition both arrays into two halves such that the left half contains the same number of elements as the right half. We will then check if the maximum element on the left side is less than or equal to the minimum element on the right side.

In Python, strings are immutable sequences of Unicode characters. Python provides a rich set of methods to perform different operations on strings.\n\nOne such operation is changing the case of characters in a string. Python has built-in methods for this purpose:\n- `str.upper()`: Converts all lowercase letters in a string to uppercase.\n- `str.lower()`: Converts all uppercase letters in a string to lowercase.\n- `str.capitalize()`: Converts the first character of a string to uppercase and the rest to lowercase.\n- `str.title()`: Converts the first character of each word to uppercase and the rest to lowercase.\n\nFor competitive programming, string manipulation problems can range from simple case conversions to more complex operations like pattern matching, string searching, and transformations based on specific rules.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **String Rotation**: Given two strings, check if one is a rotation of the other. The solution involves concatenating one string to itself and checking if the other string is a substring of the result. Use the `in` operator to check for a substring.\n\n2. **Palindrome Check**: Determine if a given string is a palindrome. A palindrome is a string that reads the same backward as forward. Convert the string to the same case (either upper or lower) before checking for equality with its reverse.\n\n3. **Caesar Cipher**: Implement a Caesar cipher, which is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down the alphabet.

An array is a collection of items stored at contiguous memory locations. In Python, lists are used as arrays. They can contain items of different types but usually, the items all have the same type.\n\nSwapping two elements in an array involves the following steps:\n1. Access the elements at their respective indices.\n2. Store one of the elements in a temporary variable.\n3. Assign the value of the second element to the first.\n4. Assign the value stored in the temporary variable to the second element.\n\nIn Python, you can also perform tuple unpacking to swap elements without a temporary variable:\n```python\na, b = b, a\n```\n\nThis line will swap the values of `a` and `b`.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Reverse an array**: Given an array, reverse the order of its elements.\n   - Solution: Iterate over the array from the start to the middle while swapping the elements from the start with the corresponding elements from the end.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def reverse_array(arr):\n         start = 0\n         end = len(arr) - 1\n         while start < end:\n             arr[start], arr[end] = arr[end], arr[start]\n             start += 1\n             end -= 1\n         return arr\n     ```\n\n2. **Rotate an array**: Given an array, rotate the array to the right by `k` steps, where `k` is non-negative.\n   - Solution: Reverse the whole array, then reverse the first `k` elements, and finally reverse the rest of the array.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def rotate_array(arr, k):\n         k = k % len(arr)\n         arr[:] = arr[::-1]\n         arr[:k] = arr[:k][::-1]\n         arr[k:] = arr[k:][::-1]\n         return arr\n     ```\n\n3. **Cyclically rotate an array by one**: Given an array, cyclically rotate the array clockwise by one.\n   - Solution: Swap the last element with each of the elements before it one by one, starting from the second to last element and moving to the start of the array.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def cyclic_rotate(arr):\n         for i in range(len(arr) - 1, 0, -1):\n             arr[i], arr[i-1] = arr[i-1], arr[i]\n         return arr\n     ```\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n- Explanation of the solution:\n  The solution is straightforward.

The algorithm compares the target value to the middle element of the array; if they are not equal, the half in which the target cannot lie is eliminated, and the search continues on the remaining half until the target is found or the remaining half is empty.\n\nFor finding the first missing number in a sorted list of natural numbers, we can modify the binary search as follows:\n1. Compare the middle element of the array to its index.\n2. If the middle element is equal to its index plus the starting number of the array, then the missing number must be in the right half of the array.\n3. If the middle element is not equal to its index plus the starting number of the array, then the missing number must be in the left half of the array or it is the middle element itself.\n4.

In Python, strings are immutable, which means they cannot be changed after they are created. Therefore, when we manipulate strings, we are actually creating new strings.\n\nTo replace parts of a string in Python, you can use several methods:\n\n1. The `replace()` method: This is a built-in method that returns a new string with all occurrences of a substring replaced with another substring.\n   ```python\n   new_string = original_string.replace(\"old_substring\", \"new_substring\")\n   ```\n\n2. List comprehension: You can convert the string into a list of characters, perform the replacement on each character, and then join the list back into a string.\n   ```python\n   new_string = ''.join(['new_substring' if c == 'old_substring' else c for c in original_string])\n   ```\n\n3. The `re` module: For more complex replacements, you can use regular expressions with the `re` module.\n   ```python\n   import re\n   new_string = re.sub(r\"old_substring\", \"new_substring\", original_string)\n   ```\n\nIn the given problem, we are replacing spaces, which can be done easily with the `replace()` method.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. URLify: Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with '%20'. Assume that the string has sufficient space at the end to hold the additional characters, and that you are given the \"true\" length of the string.\n   Solution: Similar to the original problem, we can use the `replace()` method to replace spaces with '%20'.\n   ```python\n   def urlify(string, length):\n       return string[:length].replace(\" \", \"%20\")\n   ```\n\n2.

In this case, we want to check if a number is even. An even number is divisible by 2 with no remainder. In Python, you can check this using the modulo operator `%`.\n\nHere's a quick example of how you might use iteration and conditional checking to find even numbers in a list:\n\n```python\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\neven_numbers = []\n\nfor number in numbers:\n    if number % 2 == 0:\n        even_numbers.append(number)\n\nprint(even_numbers)  # Output: [2, 4, 6]\n```\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Finding Prime Numbers**: Given a list of numbers, write a function to find all the prime numbers in the list.

In Python, strings are immutable, which means they cannot be changed after they are created. However, you can create a new string based on the original one with the desired modifications.\n\nTo solve the problem at hand, you can use a simple loop to iterate over each character in the string. If the character is a space, you replace it with an underscore, and if it's an underscore, you replace it with a space. You can use a conditional statement (if-else) to check each character and perform the replacement.\n\nAnother approach is to use the built-in `replace()` method of strings in Python, which returns a new string with all occurrences of a specified value replaced with another value.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **URLify**: Given a string, write a method to replace all spaces with '%20'. You may assume that the string has sufficient space at the end to hold the additional characters.\n\n   Solution: Iterate through the string and replace each space with '%20'.

The XOR operation, also known as exclusive or, takes two bits and returns 1 if the bits are different, and 0 if they are the same. When applied to numbers, the XOR operation is performed bit by bit.\n\nTo solve the problem efficiently, we need to recognize that the XOR of a number with itself is always 0, and the XOR operation is commutative, meaning that the order of operands does not change the result (i.e., `a XOR b = b XOR a`).\n\n## Tutorial:\nThe XOR operation has several interesting properties that are useful in solving problems:\n\n1. **Identity Property**: `a XOR 0 = a`\n2. **Self-Inverse**: `a XOR a = 0`\n3. **Commutative**: `a XOR b = b XOR a`\n4. **Associative**: `(a XOR b) XOR c = a XOR (b XOR c)`\n\nWhen dealing with arrays and the XOR operation, one common approach is to count the number of times each bit position (0, 1, 2, ...) is set to 1 among all numbers. Since we are interested in pairs, we can calculate the contribution of each bit position to the final sum by determining how many pairs can be formed where the bit is set in one number and not set in the other.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Finding the single number**: Given a non-empty array of integers where every element appears twice except for one, find that single one.

Heap sort is a comparison-based sorting technique based on a binary heap data structure. It's similar to selection sort where we first find the maximum element and place it at the end. We repeat the same process for the remaining elements.\n\n## Tutorial:\nHeap sort involves building a heap from the input data, and then repeatedly extracting the maximum element from the heap and placing it at the end of the sorted array. The steps are as follows:\n\n1. Build a max heap from the input data.\n2. At this point, the largest item is stored at the root of the heap. Replace it with the last item of the heap followed by reducing the size of the heap by 1. Finally, heapify the root of the tree.\n3. Repeat step 2 while the size of the heap is greater than 1.\n\nThe process of heapifying a tree involves moving the root of the tree down the tree such that the property of the heap is maintained.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Kth Largest Element in an Array**: Find the kth largest element in an unsorted array. This problem can be solved by first creating a min-heap of size k. Then, for each element after the kth, if it's larger than the min-heap's root, replace the root with this element and heapify. The root of the min-heap will be the kth largest element.\n\n2. **Merge K Sorted Lists**: Given k sorted linked lists, merge them into one sorted linked list. We can use a min-heap to solve this problem by inserting the first node of each list into the heap. Then, repeatedly extract the smallest element from the heap and add it to the merged list, inserting the next node from the extracted element's list into the heap.\n\n3. **Sort Characters By Frequency**: Given a string, sort it in decreasing order based on the frequency of characters. This can be solved by using a max-heap to store the frequency of each character and then constructing the sorted string by repeatedly extracting the maximum frequency characters from the heap.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\nThe `heap_sort` function will first convert the list into a max heap. Then, it will repeatedly swap the first element of the heap (the maximum value) with the last element of the unsorted portion of the list, reduce the size of the heap by one, and heapify the root to maintain the max heap property. This process is repeated until the heap size is reduced to 1.\n\nHere's the Python3 code:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef heapify(arr: List[int], n: int, i: int):\n    largest = i\n    left = 2 * i + 1\n    right = 2 * i + 2\n\n    if left < n and arr[i] < arr[left]:\n        largest = left\n\n    if right < n and arr[largest] < arr[right]:\n        largest = right\n\n    if largest != i:\n        arr[i], arr[largest] = arr[largest], arr[i]\n        heapify(arr, n, largest)\n\ndef heap_sort(arr: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n    n = len(arr)\n\n    # Build a maxheap.\n    for i in range(n // 2 - 1, -1, -1):\n        heapify(arr, n, i)\n\n    # One by one extract elements\n    for i in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n        arr[i], arr[0] = arr[0], arr[i]  # swap\n        heapify(arr, i, 0)\n\n    return arr\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(heap_sort([12, 11, 13, 5, 6, 7]))\n```\n\nThis code will output the sorted array `[5, 6, 7, 11, 12, 13]`."], "prompt_tokens": [200], "completion_tokens": [819], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": true, "task_id": "mbpp_635_heap_sort"}

In Python, strings are immutable, meaning that once a string is created, it cannot be changed. However, you can create new strings based on operations performed on existing ones.\n\nConditional statements are used to execute different blocks of code based on certain conditions.

You can check multiple conditions using `elif` (else if) and `else` to handle the case where none of the conditions are met.\n\nIn this problem, we will use a `for` loop to iterate over the list of names. For each name, we will use an `if` statement to check if the first character (accessed using indexing `name[0]`) is a lowercase letter. We can use the `str.islower()` method to check if a character is lowercase.

The stack will help us to identify the portions of the string that are inside the parentheses, which we need to remove.\n\n## Tutorial:\nA stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle. The basic operations associated with a stack are:\n\n- Push: Add an element to the top of the stack.\n- Pop: Remove the top element from the stack.\n- Peek/Top: Get the top element of the stack without removing it.\n- IsEmpty: Check if the stack is empty.\n\nTo solve the problem of removing text within parentheses, we can iterate through the string character by character and use the following algorithm:\n\n1. Create an empty stack.\n2. For each character in the string:\n   - If the character is an opening parenthesis `'('`, push its index onto the stack.\n   - If the character is a closing parenthesis `')'`, pop the top element from the stack (which corresponds to the matching opening parenthesis) and mark the range of indices from the opening to the closing parenthesis for removal.\n3. After the iteration, remove all marked ranges from the string.\n4. Return the modified string without the parentheses and the text within them.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Balanced Parentheses**: Given a string containing just the characters `'('` and `')'`, determine if the input string is valid. An input string is valid if every opening parenthesis has a corresponding closing parenthesis, and all parentheses are properly nested and closed.\n\n   Solution: Use a stack to keep track of opening parentheses. When a closing parenthesis is encountered, check if the stack is not empty and the top is an opening parenthesis, then pop from the stack. If the stack is empty or the top is not an opening parenthesis, the string is not valid. After processing all characters, if the stack is empty, the string is valid.\n\n2. **Longest Valid Parentheses**: Given a string containing just the characters `'('` and `')'`, find the length of the longest valid (well-formed) parentheses substring.\n\n   Solution: Similar to the balanced parentheses problem, use a stack to keep track of indices of opening parentheses. Additionally, use a variable to keep track of the starting index of the current valid substring. When a closing parenthesis is encountered and the stack is not empty, pop from the stack and calculate the length of the valid substring.\n\n3. **Generate Parentheses**: Given n pairs of parentheses, write a function to generate all combinations of well-formed parentheses.\n\n   Solution: Use a recursive backtracking algorithm that keeps track of the number of opening and closing parentheses that have been placed so far. If the number of opening parentheses is less than `n`, we can place an opening parenthesis. If the number of closing parentheses is less than the number of opening parentheses, we can place a closing parenthesis.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\nWe will iterate through the string and use a stack to keep track of the indices of opening parentheses.

Specifically, we will be using Python's string indexing and conditional statements to check for the presence of the character 'z' within the string, excluding the first and last characters.\n\n## Tutorial:\nString manipulation is a common task in programming where you need to perform operations on strings such as slicing, concatenating, or searching for substrings. Python provides a rich set of methods to work with strings.\n\nPattern matching, on the other hand, involves finding sequences of characters that match a particular pattern. This can be done using simple conditional checks or more advanced techniques like regular expressions.\n\nFor this problem, we will use string indexing to access individual characters in the string. In Python, strings are indexed with the first character having index 0. You can access a character at a specific index by using square brackets `[]`. For example, `text[0]` would give you the first character of the string `text`.\n\nTo check if 'z' appears in the middle of the word, we will iterate over the string from the second character to the second-to-last character and check if any of these characters is 'z'. If we find 'z' in this range, we return `True`; otherwise, we return `False`.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Substring Check**: Given two strings, write a function to check if one string is a substring of the other.\n   - Solution: Use Python's `in` operator or the `find()` method to check for a substring.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def is_substring(str1: str, str2: str) -> bool:\n         return str1 in str2 or str2 in str1\n     ```\n\n2. **Palindrome Check**: Write a function to check if a given string is a palindrome (reads the same backward as forward).\n   - Solution: Compare the string with its reverse and check if they are equal.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def is_palindrome(text: str) -> bool:\n         return text == text[::-1]\n     ```\n\n3. **Count Vowels**: Write a function that counts the number of vowels in a given string.\n   - Solution: Iterate over the string and use a set of vowels to check if a character is a vowel, then increment a counter.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def count_vowels(text: str) -> int:\n         vowels = 'aeiouAEIOU'\n         return sum(1 for char in text if char in vowels)\n     ```\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n- Explanation of the solution:\n  We will iterate over the string from the second character (index 1) to the second-to-last character (index `len(text) - 2`).

The algorithm involves reversing the elements of the array from the start up to the k-th position.\n\n## Tutorial:\nReversing a subarray within an array is a common operation in many algorithms. The basic idea is to swap elements symmetrically around the center of the subarray you want to reverse. Here's a step-by-step guide to reversing a subarray:\n\n1. Identify the subarray you want to reverse. In this case, it's from the start of the array up to the k-th element.\n2. Use two pointers: one starting at the beginning of the subarray and the other at the end of the subarray (k-th position).\n3. Swap the elements at the two pointers.\n4. Move the start pointer forward and the end pointer backward.\n5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until the start pointer is greater than or equal to the end pointer.\n\nThis process can be done in-place, meaning no additional memory is required other than the input array itself.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Reverse a Linked List**: Given the head of a singly linked list, reverse the list, and return the reversed list. The solution involves similar steps as reversing an array, but instead of using array indices, you manipulate the `next` pointers of the nodes in the linked list.\n\n2. **Rotate Array**: Given an array, rotate the array to the right by k steps, where k is non-negative. This can be solved by reversing the entire array first, then reversing the first k elements, and finally reversing the remaining elements.\n\n3. **Next Permutation**: Implement next permutation, which rearranges numbers into the lexicographically next greater permutation of numbers. This involves finding the first decreasing element from the end, swapping it with a just larger element, and then reversing the subarray after the original decreasing element's position.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\nThe solution involves reversing the elements of the array from the start up to the k-th position. We will use two pointers: one at the start of the array and the other at the k-th position.

During this transformation, items within the original dictionary can be conditionally included in the new dictionary and transformed as needed.\n\nThe syntax for dictionary comprehension is:\n```python\n{key: value for (key, value) in dict.items() if condition}\n```\n\nHere, `dict.items()` returns an iterable of the dictionary's key-value pairs. The `if condition` part is optional; if included, it will filter out items for which the condition is not true.\n\nFor example, if we want to create a new dictionary with only the items where the value is greater than 10, we could do:\n```python\noriginal_dict = {'a': 5, 'b': 15, 'c': 20}\nfiltered_dict = {k: v for k, v in original_dict.items() if v > 10}\n# filtered_dict will be {'b': 15, 'c': 20}\n```\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Filtering a Dictionary by Value**: Given a dictionary of stock prices, write a function to return a new dictionary with only the stocks that have a price greater than $100.\n   \n   Solution: Use dictionary comprehension to iterate over the dictionary and apply the condition to filter out stocks with prices less than or equal to $100.\n\n2. **Inverting a Dictionary**: Given a dictionary where the values are unique, write a function to invert the dictionary so that the keys become values and the values become keys.\n\n   Solution: Use dictionary comprehension to swap the keys and values of the dictionary.\n\n3. **Grouping Items**: Given a list of tuples where the first item is a category and the second item is a value, write a function to create a dictionary where each key is a category and the value is a list of corresponding values.\n\n   Solution: Use a default dictionary or a normal dictionary with checks to append values to lists, grouping them by their category.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\nThe solution involves iterating over the `students` dictionary and applying a condition to check if both the height and weight of each student are above the given minimums.

This problem does not require any complex algorithms. It is a simple problem that can be solved using a loop to iterate over the indices of the lists and compare the elements at each index.\n\n## Tutorial:\nIn competitive programming, problems that involve iterating over arrays or lists and comparing their elements are quite common. The basic idea is to use a loop to go through each element of the arrays and perform a certain operation. In this case, the operation is a comparison.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide to solve such problems:\n1. Ensure that the input arrays or lists are of the same length to avoid index out of range errors.\n2. Initialize a counter to keep track of the number of times a certain condition is met.\n3. Use a loop (for example, a `for` loop) to iterate over the indices of the arrays.\n4. At each index, compare the elements of the two arrays.\n5. If the elements are the same, increment the counter.\n6. After the loop ends, return the counter as it represents the number of indices where the arrays have the same value.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Intersection of Two Arrays**: Given two arrays, write a function to compute their intersection. The solution involves iterating over one array and checking if each element is present in the second array, typically using a set for faster lookups.\n\n2. **Find All Duplicates in an Array**: Given an array of integers, some elements appear twice and others appear once. Write a function to find all the elements that appear twice in this array. The solution often involves using a hash map to keep track of the counts of each element.\n\n3. **Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock**: You are given an array where the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i. If you were only permitted to complete at most one transaction (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock), design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. The solution involves iterating over the array while keeping track of the minimum price seen so far and the maximum profit that can be achieved.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\nThe solution involves iterating over the indices of the given lists `nums1` and `nums2`.

Regular expressions can match patterns in strings, which is useful for extracting data enclosed by specific characters like quotation marks.\n\n3. **State Machines**: Implementing a simple state machine that iterates over each character in the string and changes state when it encounters a quotation mark can also be used to extract the desired substrings.\n\nFor this problem, regular expressions are a powerful and concise way to extract substrings between quotation marks.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Extracting Data from Logs**: Given a log file where some data is enclosed in brackets, extract all the data within brackets.\n   Solution: Use regular expressions to match patterns enclosed in brackets.\n   ```python\n   import re\n   def extract_data_from_logs(logs):\n       return re.findall(r'\\[(.*?)\\]', logs)\n   ```\n\n2. **Parsing CSV**: Given a CSV file where values may be enclosed in double quotes, especially if they contain commas, parse the CSV and create a list of lists with the values.\n   Solution: Use a CSV parser or regular expressions to handle the quoted values.\n   ```python\n   import csv\n   def parse_csv(file_path):\n       with open(file_path, newline='') as csvfile:\n           return list(csv.reader(csvfile))\n   ```\n\n3. **HTML Tag Extractor**: Given an HTML string, extract the content between the `<title>` tags.\n   Solution: Use regular expressions to find content between `<title>` and `</title>`.\n   ```python\n   import re\n   def extract_title(html):\n       match = re.search(r'<title>(.*?)</title>', html)\n       return match.group(1) if match else None\n   ```\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\nWe will use regular expressions to find all substrings that are enclosed within double quotation marks. The pattern for matching text inside double quotes is `\"[^\"]*\"`. The `[^\"]` part matches any character except a double quote, and the `*` allows for any number of such characters.\n\nHere's the Python code:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef extract_quotation(text1: str) -> List[Any]:\n    # Regular expression pattern for finding text within quotes\n    pattern = r'\"(.*?)\"'\n    # Find all matches of the pattern in the input string\n    matches = re.findall(pattern, text1)\n    # Return the list of matches\n    return matches\n\n# Example usage:\ntext = 'She said, \"Hello, World!\" and then left.'\nprint(extract_quotation(text))  # Output: ['Hello, World!']\n```\n\nThis function will return a list of all substrings that are found within quotation marks in the input string. The `findall` method of the `re` module returns all non-overlapping matches of the pattern in the string, as a list of strings. The `?` in the pattern makes the match non-greedy, meaning it will match the shortest possible string that satisfies the pattern, which is important for handling multiple quoted substrings in the input text."], "prompt_tokens": [209], "completion_tokens": [747], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": true, "task_id": "mbpp_725_extract_quotation"}

When you need to access the current element and the next element during iteration, you can use the `enumerate` function to get the index of the current element and then access the next element using that index.\n\nHere's a quick tutorial on how to use a `for` loop with `enumerate` to solve problems like the one given:\n\n```python\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nresult = []\n\nfor i, number in enumerate(numbers):\n    if i < len(numbers) - 1:  # Check to avoid index out of range\n        next_number = numbers[i + 1]\n        product = number * next_number\n        result.append(product)\n\nprint(result)  # Output: [2, 6, 12, 20]\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can use a list comprehension to achieve the same result in a more concise way:\n\n```python\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nresult = [numbers[i] * numbers[i + 1] for i in range(len(numbers) - 1)]\n\nprint(result)  # Output: [2, 6, 12, 20]\n```\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Prefix Sum**: Given a list of numbers, return a new list where each element at index `i` is the sum of the numbers up to the `i`th element in the original list.\n   Solution: Iterate over the original list, keeping a running sum, and append the sum to the new list at each step.\n   ```python\n   def prefix_sum(numbers):\n       result = []\n       current_sum = 0\n       for number in numbers:\n           current_sum += number\n           result.append(current_sum)\n       return result\n   ```\n\n2. **Cumulative Product**: Similar to the prefix sum, but instead of summing, you multiply the elements cumulatively.\n   Solution: Use a loop to calculate the cumulative product and store it in a new list.\n   ```python\n   def cumulative_product(numbers):\n       result = []\n       current_product = 1\n       for number in numbers:\n           current_product *= number\n           result.append(current_product)\n       return result\n   ```\n\n3. **Pairwise Differences**: Given a list of numbers, return a new list containing the absolute difference between each pair of consecutive elements.\n   Solution: Iterate over the list and calculate the absolute difference between each pair of elements.\n   ```python\n   def pairwise_differences(numbers):\n       return [abs(numbers[i] - numbers[i + 1]) for i in range(len(numbers) - 1)]\n   ```\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\nThe solution involves iterating over the input list using a `for` loop or a list comprehension. For each element at index `i`, we multiply it by the element at index `i+1` and store the result in a new list. We stop the iteration one element before the last to avoid an index out of range error.\n\nHere's the Python3 code:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List, Any\n\ndef multiply_elements(test_tup: List[int]) -> List[Any]:\n    # Using list comprehension to multiply each element with the next one\n    return [test_tup[i] * test_tup[i + 1] for i in range(len(test_tup) - 1)]\n\n# Example usage:\ntest_tup = [1, 2, 3, 4]\nprint(multiply_elements(test_tup))  # Output: [2, 6, 12]\n```\n\nThis code will correctly solve the problem as stated."], "prompt_tokens": [244], "completion_tokens": [842], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": true, "task_id": "mbpp_726_multiply_elements"}

Binary search is an efficient algorithm for finding an item from a sorted list of items. It works by repeatedly dividing in half the portion of the list that could contain the item, until you've narrowed down the possible locations to just one.\n\n## Tutorial:\nBinary search starts by comparing the middle item of the array with the target value. If the target value matches the middle item, you've found the index of the item. If the target value is less than the middle item, you continue the search on the left half of the array; otherwise, you continue on the right half.\n\nFor finding the first occurrence of a number, you need to modify the standard binary search algorithm. When you find a match, instead of stopping, you continue the search on the left half to see if there are duplicates that come before the current match.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide to implementing this modified binary search:\n\n1. Initialize two pointers, `low` at 0 and `high` at `len(A) - 1`.\n2. While `low` is less than or equal to `high`:\n   a. Calculate the middle index `mid = (low + high) // 2`.\n   b. If `A[mid]` is equal to `x`, record the index, and set `high` to `mid - 1` to continue searching in the left half.\n   c. If `A[mid]` is less than `x`, set `low` to `mid + 1`.\n   d. If `A[mid]` is greater than `x`, set `high` to `mid - 1`.\n3. If you find the element, return the recorded index. If not, return -1 to indicate that the element is not in the array.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Closest Element in a Sorted Array**: Given a sorted array and a target value, find the index of the element closest to the target. The solution involves a binary search to find the closest element by comparing the differences between the target and the elements at the middle indices.\n\n2. **Find Peak Element**: Given an array where elements are sorted in ascending order up to a peak, then descending, find the peak element.

The key insight is that each element of the array contributes to the product of several subarrays, and its contribution can be calculated based on its position in the array.\n\n## Tutorial:\nTo solve this problem, we need to understand how many times each element of the array will be part of a subarray product. For an element at index `i` in an array of length `n`, there are `(i + 1)` ways to choose the starting point of the subarray (including the element itself and all elements before it) and `(n - i)` ways to choose the ending point of the subarray (including the element itself and all elements after it). Therefore, each element `arr[i]` will be part of `(i + 1) * (n - i)` subarray products.\n\nTo find the sum of products of all subarrays, we can iterate through the array and for each element, calculate its total contribution by multiplying the element by the number of subarrays it is part of, and then summing up these contributions.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Maximum Product Subarray**: Given an array of integers, find the contiguous subarray within an array (containing at least one number) which has the largest product. The solution involves using dynamic programming to keep track of the maximum and minimum product ending at each position, considering the possibility of negative numbers flipping the sign of the product.\n\n2. **Subarray Sum Equals K**: Given an array of integers and an integer `k`, you need to find the total number of continuous subarrays whose sum equals to `k`. This can be solved using a hashmap to store the cumulative sum up to each index and checking if there is a previous sum that is equal to the current sum minus `k`.\n\n3. **Count of Range Sum**: Given an integer array `nums`, return the number of range sums that lie in `[lower, upper]` inclusive. Range sum `S(i, j)` is defined as the sum of the elements in `nums` between indices `i` and `j` (i \u2264 j), inclusive. This problem can be solved using a balanced binary search tree or a binary indexed tree to efficiently count the number of valid range sums.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\nWe will iterate through the array and for each element `arr[i]`, calculate its contribution to the sum of products of all subarrays by multiplying it with `(i + 1) * (n - i)`.

Here are some common bitwise operators:\n\n1. AND (`&`): This operator compares each bit of two numbers. If both bits are 1, the result is 1. Otherwise, it's 0.\n2. OR (`|`): This operator compares each bit of two numbers. If at least one bit is 1, the result is 1. Otherwise, it's 0.\n3. XOR (`^`): This operator compares each bit of two numbers. If the bits are different, the result is 1. If they're the same, the result is 0.\n4. NOT (`~`): This unary operator flips all the bits in the number.\n5. Left Shift (`<<`): This operator shifts all the bits in a number to the left by a certain number of positions, filling the new rightmost bits with zeros.\n6. Right Shift (`>>`): This operator shifts all the bits in a number to the right by a certain number of positions.\n\nTo toggle bits except for the first and last, we need to create a mask that has 1s in all positions except the first and last.

To solve this, create a mask with a 1 at the k-th position using `1 << k` and then use the OR operator with this mask and `n`.\n2. **Clear the k-th bit of a number**: Given a number `n` and an index `k`, clear the k-th bit of `n` to 0. To solve this, create a mask with a 0 at the k-th position using `~(1 << k)` and then use the AND operator with this mask and `n`.\n3. **Count the number of set bits**: Given a number `n`, count the number of bits set to 1. To solve this, repeatedly use the AND operator with `n` and `n-1` until `n` becomes 0, counting the number of times this operation is performed.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\nTo toggle the bits of a number except for the first and last bits, we need to create a mask that has 1s in all positions except the first and last. We can achieve this by shifting 1 to the left by the number of bits in `n` minus 2, then subtracting 1 to set all the bits to 1 except the most significant bit, and finally shifting to the right by 1 to exclude the least significant bit. We then XOR `n` with this mask.\n\nHere's the Python3 code:\n\n```python\ndef toggle_middle_bits(n: int) -> int:\n    # Calculate the number of bits in n\n    num_bits = n.bit_length()\n    \n    # Create a mask with all 1s except the first and last bit\n    mask = ((1 << (num_bits - 2)) - 1) >> 1\n    \n    # Toggle the middle bits using XOR\n    return n ^ mask\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(toggle_middle_bits(10))  # Output will be the result of toggling middle bits of binary 1010\n```\n\nThis function first calculates the number of bits in `n` using `bit_length()`.

If the target value matches the middle item, the position is returned. If the target value is less than the middle item, the search continues in the lower half of the array. If the target value is greater than the middle item, the search continues in the upper half of the array.

They are commonly used for string searching and manipulation. In Python, the `re` module provides a set of functions that allows us to search a string for a match:\n\n- `re.match()`: Determines if the regex matches at the beginning of the string.\n- `re.search()`: Scans through a string, looking for any location where the regex matches.\n- `re.findall()`: Finds all substrings where the regex matches and returns them as a list.\n- `re.sub()`: Replaces the matches with the provided string.\n\nTo define a regex pattern, you can use special characters:\n- `^`: Matches the start of a string.\n- `[ ]`: Matches any single character in brackets.\n- `a|b`: Matches either `a` or `b`.\n- `.`: Matches any character except a newline.\n- `*`: Matches 0 or more repetitions of the preceding regex.\n- `+`: Matches 1 or more repetitions of the preceding regex.\n- `?`: Matches 0 or 1 repetition of the preceding regex.\n\nFor example, to match a string that starts with a vowel, you can use the pattern `^[aeiouAEIOU]`. The `^` asserts the position at the start of the string, and `[aeiouAEIOU]` matches any single character in the set (any vowel, case insensitive).\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Matching Specific String**: Write a function to check if a given string contains the word \"Python\" using regex.\n   - Solution: Use `re.search()` with the pattern `\"Python\"` to check for a match.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     import re\n     def contains_python(string: str) -> bool:\n         return bool(re.search(r\"Python\", string))\n     ```\n\n2. **Validating Phone Numbers**: Write a function to validate if a given string is a valid phone number (e.g., `123-456-7890`).\n   - Solution: Use `re.match()` with the pattern `^\\d{3}-\\d{3}-\\d{4}$` to check for a match.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     import re\n     def is_valid_phone_number(number: str) -> bool:\n         return bool(re.match(r\"^\\d{3}-\\d{3}-\\d{4}$\", number))\n     ```\n\n3. **Extracting Email Addresses**: Write a function to extract all email addresses from a given string.\n   - Solution: Use `re.findall()` with the pattern `\\b[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\\.[A-Z|a-z]{2,}\\b`.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     import re\n     def extract_emails(text: str) -> list:\n         return re.findall(r\"\\b[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\\.[A-Z|a-z]{2,}\\b\", text)\n     ```\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n- Explanation of the solution:\n  To solve the original problem, we will use the `re.match()` function with the pattern `^[aeiouAEIOU]`.

In recursive functions, there are two main parts: the base case and the recursive case. The base case is the simplest instance of the problem, which can be solved directly without further recursion. The recursive case is where the function calls itself with a modified input, moving towards the base case.\n\nFor a geometric sum, the base case is often when `n` is 0, and the recursive case involves finding the sum of the previous terms plus the current term, which is often a fraction of the previous term.\n\nHere's a general structure of a recursive function:\n\n```python\ndef recursive_function(parameters):\n    if base_case_condition(parameters):\n        return base_case_solution\n    else:\n        return recursive_case_solution + recursive_function(modified_parameters)\n```\n\nIn the case of the geometric sum, the base case is when `n` is 0, and the recursive case involves adding `1/(2**n)` to the geometric sum of `n-1`.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Calculating Factorial**: Given a non-negative integer `n`, calculate the factorial of `n`, which is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to `n`.\n   - Solution: Use recursion to multiply `n` by the factorial of `n-1` until reaching the base case of `n=1`.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def factorial(n):\n         if n == 1:\n             return 1\n         else:\n             return n * factorial(n-1)\n     ```\n\n2. **Fibonacci Sequence**: Given a positive integer `n`, find the `n`-th number in the Fibonacci sequence, where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1.\n   - Solution: Use recursion to calculate the sum of the `n-1`-th and `n-2`-th Fibonacci numbers until reaching the base cases of `n=0` or `n=1`.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def fibonacci(n):\n         if n == 0:\n             return 0\n         elif n == 1:\n             return 1\n         else:\n             return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)\n     ```\n\n3. **Tower of Hanoi**: Given `n` disks, which can slide onto any tower, the puzzle starts with the disks in a neat stack in ascending order of size on one rod, the smallest at the top. The objective is to move the entire stack to another rod, obeying the following rules: Only one disk can be moved at a time, each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack, and no disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.\n   - Solution: Use recursion to move `n-1` disks to the auxiliary rod, then move the largest disk to the target rod, and finally move the `n-1` disks from the auxiliary rod to the target rod.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def move_tower(height, from_pole, to_pole, with_pole):\n         if height >= 1:\n             move_tower(height-1, from_pole, with_pole, to_pole)\n             move_disk(from_pole, to_pole)\n             move_tower(height-1, with_pole, to_pole, from_pole)\n     def move_disk(fp, tp):\n         print(f\"moving disk from {fp} to {tp}\")\n     ```\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n- Explanation of the solution:\n  The geometric sum of `n-1` can be calculated using the formula `1 + 1/2 + 1/4 + ... + 1/(2^(n-1))`. We can use recursion to calculate this sum by adding `1/(2**n)` to the geometric sum of `n-1` until we reach the base case of `n=0`.\n\n- Python3 code to solve the problem:\n  ```python\n  def geometric_sum(n: int) -> float:\n      if n < 0:\n          return 0\n      if n == 0:\n          return 1\n      else:\n          return 1 / (2 ** n) + geometric_sum(n - 1)\n  ```\n\nThis function will recursively calculate the geometric sum by adding the current term to the sum of the remaining terms until it reaches the base case."], "prompt_tokens": [221], "completion_tokens": [1007], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": false, "task_id": "mbpp_738_geometric_sum"}

This ensures that we only rotate the list by the necessary number of positions.\n\n3. **Collections Module**: Python's `collections` module provides a `deque` (double-ended queue) which has a `rotate` method that can be used to rotate the list efficiently.\n\n4. **In-Place Rotation**: We can also rotate the list in place by reversing parts of the list and then reversing the entire list. This is a more space-efficient method as it does not require additional space for list slices.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Array Rotation (LeetCode 189)**: Given an array, rotate the array to the right by `k` steps, where `k` is non-negative. The solution involves using the modulo operation to find the effective rotation and then using slicing to rotate the array.\n\n2. **Rotate List (LeetCode 61)**: Given the head of a linked list, rotate the list to the right by `k` places. The solution involves finding the length of the list, updating `k` using modulo operation, and then adjusting the pointers to rotate the list.\n\n3. **Cyclically Rotate an Array by One (GeeksforGeeks)**: Given an array, cyclically rotate the array clockwise by one. This is a simpler version of the rotation problem where `m` is always 1. The solution involves swapping elements or using a temporary variable to rotate the array.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\nTo solve the original problem, we will use the slicing method. We will first normalize the number of rotations `m` using the modulo operation to ensure it is within the bounds of the list length. Then, we will slice the list into two parts and concatenate them in reverse order to achieve the rotation.\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef rotate_right(lst: List[int], m: int) -> List[int]:\n    n = len(lst)\n    # Normalize the number of rotations\n    m = m % n\n    # Perform the rotation using slicing\n    return lst[-m:] + lst[:-m]\n\n# Example usage:\noriginal_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nrotated_list = rotate_right(original_list, 2)\nprint(rotated_list)  # Output: [4, 5, 1, 2, 3]\n```\n\nThis code will rotate the list to the right by `m` positions, and it handles cases where `m` is greater than the length of the list."], "prompt_tokens": [228], "completion_tokens": [702], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": true, "task_id": "mbpp_743_rotate_right"}

In Python, you can iterate over a tuple using a `for` loop. During each iteration, you can check if the current element is `None` using a simple conditional statement.\n\nHere's a quick tutorial on how to iterate over a tuple and check for `None` values:\n\n```python\nmy_tuple = (1, None, 3)\n\n# Iterate over each element in the tuple\nfor element in my_tuple:\n    # Check if the element is None\n    if element is None:\n        print(\"Found a None value!\")\n```\n\nIf you want to check if any element in the tuple is `None` and return a boolean result, you can use the `any()` function in combination with a generator expression:\n\n```python\nmy_tuple = (1, None, 3)\n\n# Check if any element is None using a generator expression\ncontains_none = any(element is None for element in my_tuple)\nprint(contains_none)  # Output: True\n```\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Finding the first None value in a list**: Given a list of elements, find the index of the first `None` value. You would iterate over the list and return the index when you encounter a `None`.\n\n2. **Counting None values in a list**: Count how many `None` values are present in a list. Iterate over the list and use a counter to keep track of `None` values.\n\n3. **Removing None values from a list**: Create a new list that contains all the elements from the original list except for `None` values. You can use list comprehension to iterate over the original list and include only non-`None` values.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n- Explanation of the solution:\nThe solution involves iterating over the tuple and checking if any element is `None`.

Dynamic programming is a method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems. It is applicable when the problem can be divided into overlapping subproblems with optimal substructure, meaning the solution to the problem can be composed of optimal solutions to its subproblems.\n\n## Tutorial:\nDynamic programming can be applied to the LCS problem by creating a 3D table where the dimensions correspond to the lengths of the three input strings. Each cell in the table, `dp[i][j][k]`, represents the length of the LCS of the substrings `X[0..i]`, `Y[0..j]`, and `Z[0..k]`.\n\nThe algorithm follows these steps:\n1. Initialize a 3D array `dp` with dimensions `(len(X)+1) x (len(Y)+1) x (len(Z)+1)` and set all values to 0.\n2. Iterate through all characters of the three strings in a nested loop.\n3. If characters `X[i]`, `Y[j]`, and `Z[k]` match, the value of `dp[i+1][j+1][k+1]` is set to `dp[i][j][k] + 1`.\n4. If the characters do not match, the value of `dp[i+1][j+1][k+1]` is the maximum of the values `dp[i][j+1][k+1]`, `dp[i+1][j][k+1]`, and `dp[i+1][j+1][k]`.\n5. The value in `dp[len(X)][len(Y)][len(Z)]` is the length of the LCS of the three strings.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Longest Common Subsequence (Two Strings)**: Given two sequences, find the length of the longest subsequence present in both of them. The solution involves a similar dynamic programming approach but with a 2D table.\n\n2. **Edit Distance**: Given two strings, find the minimum number of operations required to convert one string into the other. Operations include insertions, deletions, or substitutions. This problem also uses dynamic programming with a 2D table to keep track of operations.\n\n3. **Longest Increasing Subsequence**: Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest increasing subsequence. This problem can be solved using dynamic programming by maintaining an array that stores the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending with each element.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\nThe function `lcs_of_three` uses dynamic programming to build a 3D table `dp` that stores the length of the LCS at each point.

Therefore, any operation that seems to modify a string actually creates a new string.\n\nTo solve problems involving string manipulation, you often need to iterate over the characters in a string, use string methods like `split()`, `join()`, `replace()`, and use slicing to access parts of the string. Regular expressions can also be used for more complex pattern matching and manipulation.\n\nIn the context of our problem, we will iterate over the string and check each character to see if it's an uppercase letter.

We can check if a character is uppercase by using the `isupper()` method.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **CamelCase to snake_case conversion**: Given a string in CamelCase format, convert it to snake_case format.\n   - Solution: Iterate through the string, and whenever an uppercase letter is found, replace it with an underscore followed by the lowercase version of the letter, unless it's the first character.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def camel_to_snake(camel_str):\n         return ''.join(['_' + char.lower() if char.isupper() else char for char in camel_str]).lstrip('_')\n     ```\n\n2. **Acronym generation**: Given a phrase, generate its acronym by taking the first letter of each word and capitalizing it.\n   - Solution: Split the string into words, take the first letter of each word, capitalize it, and join them together.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def generate_acronym(phrase):\n         return ''.join(word[0].upper() for word in phrase.split())\n     ```\n\n3. **Title Case Conversion**: Given a string, convert it to title case, where the first letter of each word is capitalized.\n   - Solution: Split the string into words, capitalize the first letter of each word, and join them back together with spaces.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def title_case(s):\n         return ' '.join(word.capitalize() for word in s.split())\n     ```\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n- Explanation of the solution:\n  We will iterate through the string using a for loop. For each character, we will check if it is uppercase and not the first character in the string. If both conditions are met, we will add a space before the character. We will use a list to build the new string and then join the list into a final string to return.\n\n- Python3 code to solve the problem:\n  ```python\n  def capital_words_spaces(str1: str) -> str:\n      result = [str1[0]]  # Start with the first character\n      for char in str1[1:]:  # Iterate from the second character to the end\n          if char.isupper():  # Check if the character is an uppercase letter\n              result.append(' ')  # Append a space before the uppercase letter\n          result.append(char)  # Append the character itself\n      return ''.join(result)  # Join the list into a string and return it\n\n  # Example usage:\n  print(capital_words_spaces(\"HelloWorld\"))  # Output: \"Hello World\"\n  print(capital_words_spaces(\"ThisIsAString\"))  # Output: \"This Is A String\"\n  ```\nThis code will correctly insert spaces before capital letters in a given string, except for the first character."], "prompt_tokens": [202], "completion_tokens": [817], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": false, "task_id": "mbpp_748_capital_words_spaces"}

In Python, the `sorted()` function or the `sort()` method can be used to sort lists. By default, these functions sort lists in ascending order using the natural ordering of the list elements. However, when sorting a list of strings that represent numbers, the natural string ordering will not sort the numbers correctly (e.g., '10' will come before '2' because '1' is less than '2' in string comparison). To sort the strings numerically, we need to provide a custom key function that converts the strings to integers before the comparison is made during the sort.\n\n## Tutorial:\nSorting with a custom key in Python is a powerful feature that allows you to control the sort order of a list based on criteria you define. The `sorted()` function and the `list.sort()` method both accept a `key` parameter, which is a function that takes a single argument and returns a value to use for sorting purposes.\n\nHere's a brief tutorial on how to use a custom key for sorting:\n\n1. Define a key function that takes one argument (the list element) and returns a value that will be used for sorting.\n2. Pass this key function to the `sorted()` function or the `list.sort()` method using the `key` parameter.\n3. The sort function will use the returned values from the key function to order the elements in the list.\n\nFor example, to sort a list of strings representing numbers, you can use the `int` function as the key:\n\n```python\nnums_str = ['10', '3', '1', '5']\nnums_str_sorted = sorted(nums_str, key=int)\n```\n\nThis will sort the list numerically, resulting in `['1', '3', '5', '10']`.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Sorting Fractions**: Given a list of strings representing fractions (e.g., '1/2', '3/4', '5/6'), sort the list based on the actual numerical values of the fractions.\n   - Solution: Convert each fraction string to a floating-point number by evaluating the numerator and denominator, and then sort the list using these values as the key.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def sort_fractions(fractions):\n         return sorted(fractions, key=lambda x: eval(x))\n     ```\n\n2. **Sorting Version Numbers**: Given a list of version numbers as strings (e.g., '1.2', '1.10', '1.3'), sort them in ascending order considering the numerical value of each part of the version number.\n   - Solution: Split each version string into parts, convert each part to an integer, and sort using the tuple of integers as the key.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def sort_versions(versions):\n         return sorted(versions, key=lambda x: tuple(map(int, x.split('.'))))\n     ```\n\n3. **Sorting Complex Numbers**: Given a list of strings representing complex numbers (e.g., '1+2j', '2+1j'), sort the list based on their absolute values.\n   - Solution: Convert each string to a complex number using the `complex` function, and then sort the list using the absolute value of the complex numbers as the key.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def sort_complex(complex_numbers):\n         return sorted(complex_numbers, key=lambda x: abs(complex(x)))\n     ```\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n- Explanation of the solution:\n  The solution involves converting each string in the list to an integer using the `int` function and then sorting the list based on these integer values.\n\n- Python3 code to solve the problem:\n  ```python\n  from typing import List\n\n  def sort_numeric_strings(nums_str: List[str]) -> List[int]:\n      # Convert the list of numeric strings to a list of integers and sort it\n      return sorted(map(int, nums_str))\n\n  # Example usage:\n  nums_str = ['10', '3', '1', '5']\n  print(sort_numeric_strings(nums_str))  # Output: [1, 3, 5, 10]\n  ```"], "prompt_tokens": [225], "completion_tokens": [877], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": false, "task_id": "mbpp_749_sort_numeric_strings"}

It is a straightforward task that involves manipulating a list data structure.

Lists are mutable, meaning they can be changed after their creation, while tuples are immutable, meaning they cannot be changed once created.\n\nTo add a tuple to a list, you can use the `append()` method, which adds a single item to the end of the list. If you want to add each element of the tuple as a separate item in the list, you can use the `extend()` method or the `+=` operator, which concatenates lists.\n\nHere's a quick example of both methods:\n\n```python\nmy_list = [1, 2, 3]\nmy_tuple = (4, 5)\n\n# Using append() will add the tuple as a single item\nmy_list.append(my_tuple)\nprint(my_list)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, (4, 5)]\n\n# Using extend() or += will add elements of the tuple separately\nmy_list.extend(my_tuple)\n# Or equivalently: my_list += my_tuple\nprint(my_list)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n```\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Merging Two Sorted Lists**: Given two sorted lists, merge them into a single sorted list. This problem requires knowledge of list manipulation and the concept of pointers or indices to traverse through both lists.\n\n2. **Flatten a Nested List**: Given a list that may contain integers and/or other lists, write a function to flatten it into a single list with all integers. This problem involves recursion and list manipulation.\n\n3. **Rotate a List**: Given a list and an integer `k`, rotate the list to the right by `k` places. This problem requires list slicing and concatenation.\n\nFor each of these problems, the solution would involve iterating over lists, accessing list elements, and using list methods like `append()`, `extend()`, or slicing.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\nThe task is to add a tuple to a list.

A binary heap is a complete binary tree where the value at each node is less than or equal to the values of its children (for a min-heap). This property must hold for every node except the leaves.\n\nTo check if an array represents a min-heap, we need to verify this heap property for all non-leaf nodes. Since a binary heap can be represented as an array, the children of the node at index `i` are located at indices `2*i + 1` (left child) and `2*i + 2` (right child).\n\n## Tutorial:\nA binary heap is a binary tree with two additional constraints:\n1. Shape property: The tree is a complete binary tree; that is, all levels of the tree are fully filled except possibly the last level, which is filled from left to right.\n2. Heap property: For a min-heap, every node is less than or equal to its children. For a max-heap, every node is greater than or equal to its children.\n\nTo check if an array `arr` represents a min-heap, we iterate through all non-leaf nodes and check if the heap property is maintained. The last non-leaf node is at index `(n-2)/2` where `n` is the number of elements in the array.\n\nHere's the step-by-step algorithm:\n1. Iterate over each non-leaf node starting from index 0 to `(n-2)/2`.\n2. For each node at index `i`, check if `arr[i]` is less than or equal to `arr[2*i + 1]` and `arr[2*i + 2]` (if they exist).\n3.

However, using recursion directly can lead to a lot of repeated calculations, making it inefficient for large values of `n`. To solve this problem efficiently, we can use either memoization or an iterative approach.\n\n1. **Memoization**: This technique involves storing the results of expensive function calls and returning the cached result when the same inputs occur again. In the context of Jacobsthal numbers, we would store the values of `J(n)` as we compute them, so that when we need them again, we can look them up instead of recomputing them.\n\n2. **Iterative Approach**: Instead of using recursion, we can compute the sequence iteratively, starting from the base cases and building up to the desired `n`. This is more efficient than plain recursion because it avoids the overhead of recursive function calls and does not recompute values.\n\n3. **Matrix Exponentiation**: For sequences defined by linear recurrence relations, matrix exponentiation can be used to find the nth term in logarithmic time. This is a more advanced technique and is not necessary for this problem but is good to know for solving similar problems with larger constraints.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Fibonacci Numbers**: The Fibonacci sequence is similar to the Jacobsthal sequence and is defined by the recurrence relation `F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)` with initial conditions `F(0) = 0` and `F(1) = 1`.

To get the minimum `K` records, you can then simply return the first `K` elements of the sorted list using slicing:\n\n```python\nmin_k_records = sorted_list[:K]\n```\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **K Closest Points to Origin**: Given an array of points where points[i] = [xi, yi] represents a point on the X-Y plane and an integer K, return the K closest points to the origin (0, 0).\n\n   Solution: Sort the points by their Euclidean distance from the origin and return the first K points.\n\n2. **Top K Frequent Elements**: Given a non-empty array of integers, return the k most frequent elements.\n\n   Solution: Use a hash map to count the frequency of each element, then sort the elements by frequency and return the top K elements.\n\n3. **Kth Largest Element in an Array**: Find the kth largest element in an unsorted array. Note that it is the kth largest element in the sorted order, not the kth distinct element.\n\n   Solution: Sort the array and return the element at index `len(array) - K`.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\nThe solution involves sorting the list of tuples based on the second element (integer) in each tuple. After sorting, we return the first `K` elements of the sorted list.\n\nHere's the Python3 code:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List, Tuple\n\ndef min_k(test_list: List[Tuple[str, int]], K: int) -> List[Tuple[str, int]]:\n    # Sort the list of tuples based on the second element in each tuple\n    sorted_list = sorted(test_list, key=lambda x: x[1])\n    \n    # Return the first K elements from the sorted list\n    return sorted_list[:K]\n\n# Example usage:\ntest_list = [('gfg', 10), ('is', 3), ('best', 7), ('for', 6), ('geeks', 5)]\nK = 2\nprint(min_k(test_list, K))  # Output: [('is', 3), ('geeks', 5)]\n```\n\nThis code will correctly find the minimum `K` records from the tuple list based on the second element of each tuple."], "prompt_tokens": [249], "completion_tokens": [714], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": true, "task_id": "mbpp_753_min_k"}

If the elements match, they are common and should be added to the result list. This can be done using a simple loop or list comprehension.\n\n## Tutorial:\nTo solve problems like this, you can use a loop to iterate over the indices of the lists. In Python, you can use the built-in `zip` function to iterate over several lists in parallel. For each iteration, `zip` will return a tuple containing one element from each list, all at the same index.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide to using `zip` in a problem like this:\n\n1. Use the `zip` function to combine the lists into one iterable.\n2. Iterate over the zipped lists using a loop or list comprehension.\n3. At each iteration, you will have one element from each list. Compare these elements.\n4. If all elements are the same, add the element to the result list.\n5. Return the result list.\n\nThis method assumes that all lists are of the same length. If the lists are of different lengths, `zip` will stop at the end of the shortest list.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Intersection of Two Arrays**: Given two arrays, write a function to compute their intersection. The solution involves iterating over one array and checking if each element exists in the second array, typically using a set for faster lookups.\n\n2. **Merge Sorted Array**: You are given two sorted integer arrays nums1 and nums2, and nums1 has enough space to hold additional elements from nums2. Write a function to merge nums2 into nums1 as one sorted array. The solution involves iterating over both arrays from the end and filling nums1 from the back to the front.\n\n3. **Find All Duplicates in an Array**: Given an array of integers, some elements appear twice and others appear once. Write a function to find all the elements that appear twice in this array. The solution can involve using a dictionary to count occurrences or a set to track seen elements.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\nWe will use the `zip` function to iterate over the three lists simultaneously. For each set of elements at the same index, we will check if they are all equal.

One-pass Scan: Iterate through the list to find the smallest and second smallest elements in a single pass. This method is more efficient, with a time complexity of O(n).\n\n## Tutorial:\n### Sorting Method:\nThe sorting method involves using a sorting algorithm (like quicksort, mergesort, etc.) to sort the entire list of numbers. Once the list is sorted, the second element in the list is the second smallest, as the smallest element will be the first. This method is simple to implement but not optimal for large lists due to the sorting overhead.\n\n### One-pass Scan Method:\nThe one-pass scan method is more efficient. The idea is to traverse the list once and keep track of the smallest and second smallest elements. Here's how it works:\n- Initialize two variables, say `smallest` and `second_smallest`, with positive infinity values.\n- Iterate through each number in the list:\n  - If the current number is less than `smallest`, update `second_smallest` to `smallest`, and then update `smallest` to the current number.\n  - Else if the current number is less than `second_smallest` and not equal to `smallest`, update `second_smallest` to the current number.\n- After the iteration, `second_smallest` will hold the second smallest number in the list.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Finding the k-th Smallest Element**: Given a list of numbers and an integer k, find the k-th smallest element in the list.\n   Solution: This problem can be solved using a sorting algorithm or a selection algorithm like QuickSelect, which has an average time complexity of O(n).\n\n2. **Closest Pair of Points Problem**: Given a set of points in a 2D plane, find the pair of points with the smallest distance between them.\n   Solution: This problem can be solved using the divide and conquer approach, which involves recursively dividing the set of points and finding the smallest distance.\n\n3. **Minimum Difference Pair**: Given an array of integers, find the pair of adjacent elements that has the smallest absolute difference.\n   Solution: Sort the array and then iterate through the sorted array to find the pair of adjacent elements with the smallest difference.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\nWe will use the one-pass scan method to find the second smallest number in the list.

They are often used for string manipulation tasks such as searching, replacing, or splitting strings based on patterns.\n\nHere are some basic components of regex:\n- `.`: Matches any single character except newline.\n- `^`: Matches the start of the string.\n- `$`: Matches the end of the string.\n- `*`: Matches 0 or more repetitions of the preceding regex.\n- `+`: Matches 1 or more repetitions of the preceding regex.\n- `?`: Matches 0 or 1 repetition of the preceding regex.\n- `[abc]`: Matches any single character in the brackets.\n- `[^abc]`: Matches any single character not in the brackets.\n- `(a|b)`: Matches either a or b.\n- `\\s`: Matches any whitespace character.\n- `\\S`: Matches any non-whitespace character.\n- `\\d`: Matches any digit.\n- `\\D`: Matches any non-digit character.\n- `\\w`: Matches any alphanumeric character.\n- `\\W`: Matches any non-alphanumeric character.\n\nIn Python, the `re` module provides regular expression operations.

Regular expressions are a powerful tool for matching patterns in text, and in this case, we can use them to validate the format of a decimal number with a precision of two decimal places.\n\n## Tutorial:\nRegular expressions are sequences of characters that define a search pattern. They are commonly used for string searching and manipulation. In Python, the `re` module provides full support for Perl-like regular expressions.\n\nHere are some basic components of regex:\n- `^` asserts the start of a line.\n- `$` asserts the end of a line.\n- `\\d` matches any digit (equivalent to `[0-9]`).\n- `+` matches one or more of the preceding element.\n- `.` matches any character except a newline.\n- `?` makes the preceding element optional.\n- `{n}` matches exactly `n` occurrences of the preceding element.\n- `{n,m}` matches between `n` and `m` occurrences of the preceding element.\n\nTo match a decimal number with a precision of two, we can use the following regex pattern: `^\\d+(\\.\\d{1,2})?$`. This pattern breaks down as follows:\n- `^\\d+` ensures the string starts with one or more digits.\n- `(\\.\\d{1,2})?` is an optional group that matches a period followed by one or two digits.\n- `$` ensures that the string ends right after the optional decimal part.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Validating Phone Numbers**: Check if a list of phone numbers are valid. A valid phone number must start with 7, 8, or 9 and be 10 digits long.\n   Solution: Use the regex pattern `^[789]\\d{9}$`.\n   \n2. **Extracting Email Addresses**: Given a string, extract all valid email addresses.\n   Solution: Use a regex pattern like `[\\w\\.-]+@[\\w\\.-]+\\.\\w{2,4}` to match email addresses.\n   \n3. **Password Validation**: Write a function to validate passwords to ensure they have at least one lowercase letter, one uppercase letter, one digit, and one special character.\n   Solution: Use multiple regex checks or a single complex regex pattern like `^(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*\\d)(?=.*[@$!%*?&])[A-Za-z\\d@$!%*?&]{8,}$`.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\nWe will use the `re` module to compile a regex pattern that matches a decimal number with exactly two decimal places. Then we will use the `match` function to check if the given string matches the pattern.\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef is_decimal(num: str) -> bool:\n    # Compile a regex pattern for a decimal number with a precision of two\n    pattern = re.compile(r'^\\d+(\\.\\d{1,2})?$')\n    \n    # Use the pattern to match the input string\n    return bool(pattern.match(num))\n\n# Test cases\nprint(is_decimal(\"123.45\"))  # True\nprint(is_decimal(\"123\"))     # True\nprint(is_decimal(\"123.456\")) # False\nprint(is_decimal(\"abc.12\"))  # False\n```\n\nIn this code, the `is_decimal` function compiles a regex pattern that matches a string starting with one or more digits, optionally followed by a period and exactly one or two digits.

Using Python's built-in functions like `all()` in combination with list comprehension.\n\n## Tutorial:\n### Using a Set:\nA set in Python is a collection data type that is unordered and unindexed. Sets do not allow duplicate elements, which makes them ideal for checking the uniqueness of items in a list. By converting a list to a set, you can easily determine if all elements in the list are identical.\n\nHere's how you can use a set to check for a unique element:\n```python\ndef is_unique_using_set(lst):\n    return len(set(lst)) == 1\n```\n\n### Comparing Elements:\nAnother approach is to compare each element in the list to the first element. If any element is different, you can immediately return `False`. If you finish the loop without finding a different element, you can return `True`.\n\nHere's how you can compare elements:\n```python\ndef is_unique_by_comparing(lst):\n    first_element = lst[0]\n    for element in lst:\n        if element != first_element:\n            return False\n    return True\n```\n\n### Using all() Function:\nThe `all()` function in Python returns `True` if all elements in an iterable are true.

The algorithm involves iterating over each character in the string and checking if it is a digit. In Python, this can be easily done using the `isdigit()` method available for string objects.\n\n## Tutorial:\nString traversal is a fundamental concept where you go through each character in a string one by one. During traversal, you can perform various operations on these characters. In Python, strings are iterable, which means you can use a simple loop to traverse them.\n\nCharacter classification involves determining the type of a character. Python's standard methods like `isdigit()`, `isalpha()`, `isspace()`, etc., are used to classify characters as digits, alphabetic characters, whitespace, and so on.\n\nHere's a quick tutorial on how to use `isdigit()` in a loop to count digits in a string:\n\n```python\ndef count_digits(s):\n    digit_count = 0\n    for char in s:\n        if char.isdigit():\n            digit_count += 1\n    return digit_count\n```\n\nIn this function, `digit_count` is initialized to 0.

A polite number is a positive integer that can be expressed as the sum of two or more consecutive positive integers. The algorithm to find polite numbers typically involves iterating through possible sequences of consecutive numbers and checking if their sum equals the target number.\n\n## Tutorial:\nTo understand how to find polite numbers, we need to know a few properties:\n\n1. Every positive integer (except powers of 2) can be expressed as the sum of two or more consecutive positive integers.\n2. The number of ways a number can be expressed as the sum of consecutive numbers is equal to the number of odd factors that number has, excluding 1.\n\nFor example, the number 15 can be expressed as the sum of consecutive numbers in three different ways: 1+2+3+4+5, 4+5+6, and 7+8. Since 15 has three odd factors (3, 5, and 15), it is a polite number.\n\nTo find the nth polite number, we can iterate through natural numbers, skipping powers of 2 (since they are not polite), and count the polite numbers until we reach the nth one.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Consecutive Numbers Sum**: Given a positive integer N, how many ways can it be written as a sum of consecutive positive integers?\n   - Solution: This problem is directly related to finding the number of odd factors of the number N, excluding 1.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def consecutive_numbers_sum(N):\n         count = 0\n         for i in range(1, N+1, 2):\n             if N % i == 0:\n                 count += 1\n         return count\n     ```\n\n2. **Find the Smallest Divisor Given a Threshold**: Given an array of integers nums and an integer threshold, find the smallest divisor such that the result of dividing all the numbers in the array by this divisor and summing them up is less than or equal to the threshold.\n   - Solution: This problem can be solved using binary search to find the smallest divisor.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def smallest_divisor(nums, threshold):\n         left, right = 1, max(nums)\n         while left <= right:\n             mid = (left + right) // 2\n             if sum((num - 1) // mid + 1 for num in nums) > threshold:\n                 left = mid + 1\n             else:\n                 right = mid - 1\n         return left\n     ```\n\n3. **Maximum Sum of 3 Non-Overlapping Subarrays**: Given an integer array nums and an integer k, find three non-overlapping subarrays of length k with maximum sum and return their starting indices.\n   - Solution: This problem can be solved using dynamic programming to keep track of the best subarrays of length k.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def max_sum_of_three_subarrays(nums, k):\n         n = len(nums)\n         sums = [0] * (n + 1)\n         for i in range(n):\n             sums[i + 1] = sums[i] + nums[i]\n         left, right = [0] * n, [n - k] * n\n         total = sums[k] - sums[0]\n         for i in range(k, n):\n             if sums[i + 1] - sums[i + 1 - k] > total:\n                 left[i] = i + 1 - k\n                 total = sums[i + 1] - sums[i + 1 - k]\n             else:\n                 left[i] = left[i - 1]\n         total = sums[n] - sums[n - k]\n         for i in range(n - k - 1, -1, -1):\n             if sums[i + k] - sums[i] >= total:\n                 right[i] = i\n                 total = sums[i + k] - sums[i]\n             else:\n                 right[i] = right[i + 1]\n         ans = None\n         for i in range(k, n - 2 * k):\n             l, r = left[i - 1], right[i + k]\n             total = (sums[i + k] - sums[i]) + (sums[l + k] - sums[l]) + (sums[r + k] - sums[r])\n             if ans is None or total > ans[0]:\n                 ans = (total, l, i, r)\n         return ans[1:]\n     ```\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\nTo find the nth polite number, we will skip all powers of 2 since they are not polite and count the remaining numbers until we reach the nth polite number.\n\nPython3 code:\n```python\ndef is_polite(n: int) -> int:\n    count = 0\n    number = 1\n    while count < n:\n        number += 1\n        if (number & (number - 1)) != 0:  # Check if the number is not a power of 2\n            count += 1\n    return number\n\n# Example usage:\nnth_polite_number = is_polite(5)\nprint(nth_polite_number)  # Output will be the 5th polite number\n```\n\nThis code will correctly find the nth polite number by counting all non-power-of-2 numbers until the nth one is reached."], "prompt_tokens": [204], "completion_tokens": [1156], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": true, "task_id": "mbpp_765_is_polite"}

We will iterate through the given list and create pairs of consecutive items. This is a straightforward problem that does not require complex algorithms. It primarily tests the understanding of list manipulation and tuple creation in Python.\n\n## Tutorial:\nIteration is a fundamental concept in programming where you go through elements of a collection one by one. In Python, you can iterate over a list using a for loop or a list comprehension.\n\nWhen iterating over a list to create pairs of consecutive items, you can use the `zip` function, which is used to combine two or more iterables (like lists or tuples) element-wise. When used with a single list, you can create pairs by offsetting the original list by one element.\n\nHere's a quick example of how you can use `zip` to create pairs:\n\n```python\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]\npairs = list(zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))\nprint(pairs)  # Output: [(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4)]\n```\n\nIn the above code, `numbers[1:]` creates a new list that starts from the second element of the original list, effectively creating pairs of consecutive items when zipped with the original list.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Sliding Window Maximum**: Given an array of integers and a number k, find the maximum value in each sliding window of size k.\n   - Solution: Use a deque to keep track of the indices of the maximum elements within the current window. Iterate through the array, updating the deque and the result list.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     from collections import deque\n     def maxSlidingWindow(nums, k):\n         q = deque()\n         res = []\n         for i in range(len(nums)):\n             while q and nums[q[-1]] < nums[i]:\n                 q.pop()\n             q.append(i)\n             if q[0] == i - k:\n                 q.popleft()\n             if i >= k - 1:\n                 res.append(nums[q[0]])\n         return res\n     ```\n\n2. **Find All Duplicates in an Array**: Given an array of integers, some elements appear twice and others appear once. Find all the elements that appear twice in this array.\n   - Solution: Iterate through the array and for each element, negate the element at the index equal to the value of the current element. If the number at that index is already negative, it means the element has appeared before.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def findDuplicates(nums):\n         duplicates = []\n         for num in nums:\n             index = abs(num) - 1\n             if nums[index] < 0:\n                 duplicates.append(index + 1)\n             nums[index] = -nums[index]\n         return duplicates\n     ```\n\n3. **Longest Consecutive Sequence**: Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.\n   - Solution: Use a set to store all elements.

The most common approach is to use a dictionary (hash map) to store the frequency of each element in the array. This allows us to check if the complement of the current element (sum - current element) exists in the array in constant time.\n\n## Tutorial:\nTo solve this problem using a hash map, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialize an empty hash map (dictionary in Python) to store the frequency of each element in the array.\n2. Initialize a counter to keep track of the number of pairs found.\n3. Iterate through each element in the array:\n   - Calculate the complement by subtracting the current element from the target sum.\n   - Check if the complement is present in the hash map. If it is, increment the counter by the frequency of the complement.\n   - Update the frequency of the current element in the hash map.\n4. Return the counter as the result.\n\nThis algorithm has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array, because we are iterating through the array only once. The space complexity is O(n) as well, due to the hash map storing the frequency of elements.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Two Sum**: Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`. The solution involves using a hash map to store the indices of the elements. As you iterate through the array, you check if the complement (target - current element) exists in the hash map. If it does, you return the current index and the index of the complement.\n\n2. **Four Sum**: Given an array `nums` of n integers, return all the unique quadruplets `[nums[a], nums[b], nums[c], nums[d]]` such that:\n   - `0 <= a, b, c, d < n`\n   - `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are distinct.\n   - `nums[a] + nums[b] + nums[c] + nums[d] == target`\n   You can solve this problem by using a combination of two pointers and hashing. First, sort the array. Then, for each pair of elements, use a two-pointer approach to find the other two elements that sum up to the target.\n\n3. **Subarray Sum Equals K**: Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `k`, you need to find the total number of continuous subarrays whose sum equals to `k`. This can be solved using a hash map to store the cumulative sum up to the current index and the frequency of each sum. As you iterate through the array, you update the cumulative sum and use the hash map to find the number of times the sum `cumulative_sum - k` has occurred.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\n- We will use a hash map to store the frequency of each element.\n- For each element in the array, we will calculate its complement (sum - current element).\n- If the complement is in the hash map, we add its frequency to our count.\n- We update the frequency of the current element in the hash map.\n- Finally, we return the count of pairs.\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef get_pairs_count(arr: List[int], sum: int) -> int:\n    freq_map = {}\n    count = 0\n    \n    for num in arr:\n        complement = sum - num\n        if complement in freq_map:\n            count += freq_map[complement]\n        \n        freq_map[num] = freq_map.get(num, 0) + 1\n    \n    return count\n\n# Example usage:\narr = [1, 5, 7, -1, 5]\nsum = 6\nprint(get_pairs_count(arr, sum))  # Output: 3\n```\n\nIn the example usage, the pairs that sum up to 6 are (1, 5), (5, 1), and (7, -1), so the function returns 3."], "prompt_tokens": [226], "completion_tokens": [865], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": true, "task_id": "mbpp_767_get_pairs_count"}

The stack is ideal for this kind of problem because it operates on a Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle, which matches the nature of properly nested parentheses.\n\n## Tutorial:\nTo check for balanced parentheses, you can iterate through each character in the expression and perform the following steps:\n\n1. Initialize an empty stack.\n2. For each character in the expression:\n   - If the character is an opening bracket (i.e., '(', '[', or '{'), push it onto the stack.\n   - If the character is a closing bracket (i.e., ')', ']', or '}'), check if the stack is empty. If the stack is empty, the expression is not balanced. If the stack is not empty, pop the top element from the stack. If the popped element does not correspond to the matching opening bracket for the closing bracket, the expression is not balanced.\n3. After processing all characters, if the stack is empty, the expression is balanced. If the stack is not empty, some opening brackets have not been closed, so the expression is not balanced.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Valid Parentheses (LeetCode 20)**: Given a string containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.

In Python, strings are immutable sequences of Unicode characters, and they come with a rich set of methods to perform different operations.\n\nTo solve the problem at hand, we will use the `split()` method to divide the input string into a list of words. This method splits a string into a list where each word is a list item. The default separator is any whitespace.\n\nAfter splitting the string, we will iterate over the list of words using a loop. During each iteration, we will check the length of the current word using the `len()` function. If the length matches the specified `K`, we will not include that word in the final result.\n\nFinally, we will use the `join()` method to concatenate the remaining words into a single string, with spaces in between.

Boyer-Moore Algorithm\n\nFor simplicity and educational purposes, we will focus on the Brute Force approach, which is straightforward and easy to understand.\n\n## Tutorial:\n### Brute Force (Naive) Algorithm for String Matching:\nThe Brute Force algorithm for string matching is the simplest method where we slide the pattern over the text one by one and check for a match of characters. If a match is found, we move to the next character; if not, we slide the pattern over by one and start again.\n\nHere's how the Brute Force algorithm works step by step:\n1. Start with the beginning of the text and the pattern.\n2. Compare the first character of the pattern with the current character of the text.\n3. If they match, continue comparing subsequent characters of the pattern with the next characters of the text.\n4. If all characters of the pattern match, you've found an occurrence.\n5. If at any point the characters do not match, slide the pattern over by one position in the text.\n6. Repeat steps 2-5 until you either find a match or reach the end of the text.\n\nThe time complexity of the Brute Force algorithm is O(n*m), where n is the length of the text and m is the length of the pattern.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Problem: Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters**\n   - Description: Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.\n   - Solution: Use a sliding window technique to maintain a window of characters without duplicates.

This is a straightforward problem that does not require complex algorithms but rather a simple loop and a modulus operation to determine the oddity of both the index and the number.\n\n## Tutorial:\nIteration is the process of executing a set of instructions repeatedly. In Python, you can iterate over a list using a `for` loop or a list comprehension. The `for` loop is used to execute a block of code for each item in a given sequence (like a list or a range).\n\nConditional checking involves using `if` statements to execute a block of code only if a certain condition is true. In Python, you can use the `if` statement to check conditions and the `%` operator to check for odd or even numbers. A number is odd if it gives a remainder of 1 when divided by 2 (i.e., `num % 2 == 1`).\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Check if all elements in a list are even**:\n   - Problem: Given a list of integers, write a function to check if all elements are even.\n   - Solution: Iterate over the list and use the modulus operator to check if each number is even. If any number is not even, return `False`. If the loop completes without finding an odd number, return `True`.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def all_even(nums: List[int]) -> bool:\n         for num in nums:\n             if num % 2 != 0:\n                 return False\n         return True\n     ```\n\n2. **Find the sum of all odd numbers in a list**:\n   - Problem: Given a list of integers, write a function to return the sum of all odd numbers in the list.\n   - Solution: Iterate over the list, check if each number is odd using the modulus operator, and add it to a sum variable if it is.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def sum_of_odds(nums: List[int]) -> int:\n         return sum(num for num in nums if num % 2 == 1)\n     ```\n\n3. **Check if the list contains an odd number of even numbers**:\n   - Problem: Given a list of integers, write a function to check if there is an odd number of even numbers in the list.\n   - Solution: Iterate over the list, count the number of even numbers, and then check if this count is odd.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def odd_count_of_evens(nums: List[int]) -> bool:\n         count = sum(1 for num in nums if num % 2 == 0)\n         return count % 2 == 1\n     ```\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n- Explanation of the solution:\n  The solution involves iterating over the list using a `for` loop with an index. We check if the index is odd using `index % 2 == 1` and then check if the corresponding number is also odd using `num % 2 == 1`. If any odd index contains an even number, we return `False`. If the loop completes without finding any such case, we return `True`.\n\n- Python3 code:\n  ```python\n  def odd_position(nums: List[int]) -> bool:\n      for index, num in enumerate(nums):\n          if index % 2 == 1 and num % 2 != 1:\n              return False\n      return True\n  ```\n\nThis code will return `True` if every odd index in the list `nums` contains an odd number, and `False` otherwise."], "prompt_tokens": [207], "completion_tokens": [785], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": false, "task_id": "mbpp_775_odd_position"}

The algorithm involves iterating over the characters of the string and checking the neighboring characters to determine if they are vowels.\n\n## Tutorial:\nString traversal is a fundamental concept in programming where you go through each character in a string one by one. In Python, strings are iterable, which means you can use a loop to access each character.\n\nCharacter comparison is another basic operation where you compare characters to see if they match certain criteria. In this case, we are interested in checking if a character is a vowel.\n\nTo solve the problem at hand, you can use a for loop to iterate over the string. For each character, you need to check if the previous and next characters are vowels. You can define a set or list of vowels and use it to check if a character is a vowel. Remember to handle edge cases, such as the first and last characters, which only have one neighboring character.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Palindrome Check**: Given a string, write a function to check if it is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequences of characters that reads the same forward and backward (ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization).\n\n   Solution: Iterate from the start and end of the string simultaneously, comparing characters until the middle is reached. Ignore non-alphanumeric characters and case differences during comparison.\n\n   Python3 code:\n   ```python\n   def is_palindrome(s: str) -> bool:\n       left, right = 0, len(s) - 1\n       while left < right:\n           while left < right and not s[left].isalnum():\n               left += 1\n           while left < right and not s[right].isalnum():\n               right -= 1\n           if s[left].lower() != s[right].lower():\n               return False\n           left, right = left + 1, right - 1\n       return True\n   ```\n\n2. **Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters**: Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.\n\n   Solution: Use a sliding window approach to maintain a window of characters without duplicates. Use a set to track characters in the current window and adjust the window size as you iterate through the string.\n\n   Python3 code:\n   ```python\n   def length_of_longest_substring(s: str) -> int:\n       char_set = set()\n       left = 0\n       max_length = 0\n       for right in range(len(s)):\n           while s[right] in char_set:\n               char_set.remove(s[left])\n               left += 1\n           char_set.add(s[right])\n           max_length = max(max_length, right - left + 1)\n       return max_length\n   ```\n\n3. **Find All Anagrams in a String**: Given a string `s` and a non-empty string `p`, find all the start indices of `p`'s anagrams in `s`.\n\n   Solution: Use a sliding window with a hashmap to count characters in `p`. Slide the window across `s` and compare the character counts to find anagrams.\n\n   Python3 code:\n   ```python\n   from collections import Counter\n\n   def find_anagrams(s: str, p: str) -> list:\n       p_count = Counter(p)\n       s_count = Counter()\n       result = []\n       for i in range(len(s)):\n           s_count[s[i]] += 1\n           if i >= len(p):\n               if s_count[s[i - len(p)]] == 1:\n                   del s_count[s[i - len(p)]]\n               else:\n                   s_count[s[i - len(p)]] -= 1\n           if p_count == s_count:\n               result.append(i - len(p) + 1)\n       return result\n   ```\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\nThe solution involves iterating over the string and checking if the neighboring characters of the current character are vowels.

A common approach is to use a hash table (in Python, a dictionary) to store the count of each element as we iterate through the list. Once we have the counts, we can iterate through the dictionary and sum up the values of the elements that have a count of 1 (non-repeated elements).\n\n## Tutorial:\nA hash table is a data structure that maps keys to values for highly efficient lookup. In Python, the `dict` type is a hash table. We can use a dictionary to count the occurrences of elements in a list by using the elements as keys and incrementing their corresponding value each time we encounter them in the list.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide to solving the problem using a hash table:\n1. Initialize an empty dictionary.\n2. Iterate through each element in the list.\n3. For each element, if it is not already a key in the dictionary, add it with a value of 1. If it is already a key, increment its value by 1.\n4. After processing all elements, iterate through the dictionary.\n5.

We start by adding the first element of the input list to this temporary list. As we iterate through the input list, we compare each element with the last element of the temporary list.

In backtracking, we start with an empty solution vector and one by one add items (in the case of this problem, tuples) to it.

If the current sum is less than the target sum, we continue to add more tuples to the combination.\n\nHere is the Python3 code:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List, Tuple\n\ndef find_combinations(test_list: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:\n    def backtrack(index, current_sum, path):\n        # If the current sum is equal to the target sum, add the path to the result\n        if current_sum == target_sum:\n            result.append(path)\n            return\n        # If the current sum exceeds the target sum or we've reached the end of the list, return\n        if current_sum > target_sum or index == len(test_list):\n            return\n        # Include the current tuple in the combination and recurse\n        backtrack(index + 1, current_sum + test_list[index][0], path + [test_list[index]])\n        # Exclude the current tuple from the combination and recurse\n        backtrack(index + 1, current_sum, path)\n\n    result = []\n    target_sum = sum(x[0] for x in test_list)  # Assuming the target sum is the sum of all first elements\n    backtrack(0, 0, [])\n    return result\n\n# Example usage:\ntest_list = [(1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1)]\nprint(find_combinations(test_list))\n```\n\nThis code will output all combinations of tuples from `test_list` where the sum of the first elements of the tuples equals the sum of all first elements in the original list.

To do this, we iterate through all the numbers from 1 to the square root of `n` and check if they are divisors of `n`. If a number `i` is a divisor, then `n/i` is also a divisor. We count each pair of divisors only once. If `n` is a perfect square, we need to be careful not to count the square root twice.\n\n## Tutorial:\nTo count the number of divisors of a number `n`, we can use the following algorithm:\n\n1. Initialize a counter to 0.\n2. Loop through all the numbers `i` from 1 to the square root of `n` (inclusive).\n3. For each `i`, check if `i` divides `n` with no remainder (i.e., `n % i == 0`).\n4. If `i` is a divisor, increment the counter by 2 (one for `i` and one for `n/i`) unless `i` is the square root of `n`, in which case increment the counter by 1.\n5. After the loop, check if the counter is even or odd.\n\nThe reason we only need to check up to the square root of `n` is that if `n` has a divisor larger than its square root, the corresponding smaller divisor will already have been counted.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Problem: Perfect Numbers**\n   - Description: A perfect number is a number that is equal to the sum of its proper divisors (excluding itself).

The key insight is that each element will be part of multiple subarrays, and we need to count its contribution to the total sum accordingly.\n\n## Tutorial:\nTo understand the algorithm, let's break down the steps:\n\n1. Iterate through the array.\n2. For each element, consider it as the start of a subarray.\n3. Extend the subarray by adding elements one by one until you reach the end of the array.\n4. Only consider subarrays with odd lengths.\n5. Calculate the sum of elements in each odd length subarray.\n6. Add this sum to a total sum that accumulates the sum of all odd length subarrays.\n\nAn important observation is that the frequency of each element's contribution to the sum is related to its position in the array. Specifically, an element at index `i` will be included in `(i + 1) * (len(arr) - i)` subarrays. However, since we are only interested in odd length subarrays, we need to adjust this count to reflect only those subarrays.\n\nA more efficient approach is to pre-calculate the contribution of each element based on its position and then sum these contributions.

The task is to take a string representation of a tuple and convert it into an actual tuple of integers.

In Python, strings are immutable sequences of Unicode characters. Python provides a rich set of methods to work with strings, such as `split()`, `strip()`, `replace()`, and many others.\n\nType conversion, also known as type casting, is the process of converting a value from one data type to another. In Python, common type conversion functions include `int()`, `float()`, `str()`, and `list()`.\n\nTo solve the given problem, we can use the following steps:\n1. Remove any unwanted characters from the string that do not represent the numerical values or the tuple structure (e.g., parentheses).\n2. Split the string into individual number strings.\n3. Convert each number string into an integer.\n4. Create a tuple from the list of integers.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Parsing CSV Strings**: Given a string representing a line from a CSV file, parse the string to extract each value as an integer.\n   - Solution: Use `split(',')` to divide the string into a list of substrings, then convert each substring to an integer.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def parse_csv(csv_line: str) -> List[int]:\n         return [int(value) for value in csv_line.split(',')]\n     ```\n\n2. **Extracting Numbers from a String**: Given a string with mixed characters, extract all the numbers and return them as a list of integers.\n   - Solution: Use regular expressions to find all the numeric substrings, then convert each to an integer.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     import re\n     def extract_numbers(s: str) -> List[int]:\n         return [int(num) for num in re.findall(r'\\d+', s)]\n     ```\n\n3. **Converting a List of String Representations of Tuples**: Given a list of strings where each string represents a tuple, convert each string to a tuple of integers.\n   - Solution: Iterate over the list, and for each string, remove unwanted characters, split by comma, and convert to integers before creating a tuple.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def convert_list_of_tuples(lst: List[str]) -> List[Tuple[int]]:\n         result = []\n         for tup_str in lst:\n             nums = tup_str.strip('()').split(',')\n             result.append(tuple(int(num) for num in nums))\n         return result\n     ```\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n- Explanation of the solution:\n  The solution involves stripping the parentheses from the input string, splitting the string by commas to get individual number strings, and then converting each of those number strings into an integer.

Binary search is an efficient algorithm for finding an item from a sorted list of items. It works by repeatedly dividing in half the portion of the list that could contain the item, until you've narrowed the possible locations to just one.\n\n## Tutorial:\nBinary search starts by comparing the middle item of the array with the target value. If the target value matches the middle item, its position in the array is returned. If the target value is less than the middle item, the search continues in the lower half of the array. If the target value is greater than the middle item, the search continues in the upper half of the array. This process continues, eliminating half of the remaining items, and comparing the target value to the middle item of the new range, until the value is found or the range is empty.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide to implementing binary search:\n\n1. Find the middle index of the array.\n2. Compare the middle element with the target value.\n3. If the middle element is equal to the target, return the middle index.\n4. If the target is smaller than the middle element, repeat the search with the left half of the array.\n5. If the target is larger than the middle element, repeat the search with the right half of the array.\n6. If the range is empty, the target is not in the array, and the insertion point is where the target would have been if it were in the array.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Search in Rotated Sorted Array**: You are given a target value to search. If found in the array return its index, otherwise return -1. You may assume no duplicate exists in the array. Your algorithm's runtime complexity must be in the order of O(log n).\n   \n   Solution: Use a modified binary search to account for the rotation. Check which side of the array is normally ordered, and adjust the search space accordingly.\n\n2. **Find First and Last Position of Element in Sorted Array**: Given an array of integers nums sorted in ascending order, find the starting and ending position of a given target value. If the target is not found in the array, return [-1, -1].\n\n   Solution: Perform binary search twice, once to find the first occurrence of the target and once to find the last occurrence.\n\n3. **Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array**: Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand. Find the minimum element. You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.\n\n   Solution: Use binary search to find the point of rotation, which is the minimum element.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\nThe solution involves using a binary search to find the correct insertion point for the value `x` in the sorted list `a`. The function will return the index at which `x` should be inserted to maintain the sorted order.\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef right_insertion(a: List[int], x: int) -> int:\n    left, right = 0, len(a)\n    while left < right:\n        mid = (left + right) // 2\n        if a[mid] < x:  # If x is greater, ignore left half\n            left = mid + 1\n        else:  # If x is smaller, ignore right half\n            right = mid\n    return left  # The correct insertion point\n\n# Example usage:\n# a = [1, 3, 5, 7]\n# x = 4\n# print(right_insertion(a, x))  # Output: 2\n```\n\nThe function `right_insertion` takes a sorted list `a` and a value `x` and returns the index at which `x` should be inserted. The while loop continues until `left` is not less than `right`, which means the search space is narrowed down to a single point. The condition `if a[mid] < x` checks if the value at the middle index is less than `x`. If it is, the left half is ignored by setting `left` to `mid + 1`. Otherwise, the right half is ignored by setting `right` to `mid`. When the loop exits, `left` will be at the correct insertion point."], "prompt_tokens": [211], "completion_tokens": [893], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": true, "task_id": "mbpp_786_right_insertion"}

Regular expressions (regex) are sequences of characters that define a search pattern, usually for use in pattern matching with strings.\n\n## Tutorial:\nRegular expressions are a powerful tool for processing text. They allow you to specify complex patterns of characters that you want to search for in a string. In Python, the `re` module provides regular expression operations.\n\nHere are some basic components of regex:\n- `.` (dot): Matches any single character except newline.\n- `*`: Matches 0 or more occurrences of the preceding element.\n- `+`: Matches 1 or more occurrences of the preceding element.\n- `?`: Matches 0 or 1 occurrence of the preceding element.\n- `{n}`: Matches exactly n occurrences of the preceding element.\n- `[abc]`: Matches any single character in the set.\n- `[^abc]`: Matches any single character not in the set.\n- `(a|b)`: Matches either a or b.\n\nTo use regular expressions in Python, you typically compile a pattern using `re.compile()`, and then use methods like `search()`, `match()`, `findall()`, or `sub()` to find or replace matching strings.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Email Address Validator**: Write a function that matches a valid email address.\n   - Solution: Use a regex pattern that matches the general structure of an email, which includes characters before and after an `@` symbol, followed by a domain.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     import re\n     def is_valid_email(email: str) -> bool:\n         pattern = re.compile(r'^[\\w\\.-]+@[\\w\\.-]+\\.\\w+$')\n         return bool(pattern.match(email))\n     ```\n\n2. **Phone Number Validator**: Write a function that matches a valid US phone number.\n   - Solution: Use a regex pattern that matches the structure of a US phone number, which can include an optional country code, area code, and a seven-digit number.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     import re\n     def is_valid_phone_number(phone: str) -> bool:\n         pattern = re.compile(r'^(\\+\\d{1,2}\\s)?\\(?\\d{3}\\)?[\\s.-]?\\d{3}[\\s.-]?\\d{4}$')\n         return bool(pattern.match(phone))\n     ```\n\n3. **Password Strength Checker**: Write a function that checks if a password is strong.

Since tuples are immutable, they cannot be changed after they are created. This makes them useful for representing fixed collections of items.\n\nTo create a tuple from a list and a string, you can simply select the elements you want from the list and combine them with the string into a new tuple. This can be done using indexing for the list and direct referencing for the string.\n\nHere's a quick tutorial on how to create a tuple in Python:\n\n1. To create a tuple, you can use parentheses `()` and include the elements separated by commas.\n2. You can access elements in a list using indexing, e.g., `list[0]` for the first element.\n3. You can concatenate elements to create a tuple by using the `+` operator or by directly placing the elements within parentheses separated by commas.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Merge Sorted Arrays**: Given two sorted arrays, merge them into a single sorted array.

We can iterate through the array and whenever we find a non-zero element, we swap it with the first zero element found earlier.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n- Explanation of the solution:\nWe will iterate over the list using a `for` loop with a step of 2 to only check even indices. For each number at an even index, we will check if it is even using the modulo operator. If we find any number that is not even, we return `False`.

The goal is to remove any inner tuples and return a flat tuple containing only integers. This is a common task in data processing where nested structures need to be simplified for further analysis or storage.\n\n## Tutorial:\nTuples in Python are immutable sequences, typically used to store collections of heterogeneous data. Sometimes, tuples can contain other tuples, resulting in a nested structure. To flatten such a structure, we need to iterate through the elements and extract the integers, ignoring any tuple structures.\n\nOne way to flatten a nested tuple is to use recursion. Recursion allows us to handle tuples of arbitrary depth by calling the function within itself whenever it encounters another tuple. The base case for the recursion is when an element is not a tuple, at which point it can be added to the flattened result.\n\nAnother approach is to use a stack or a queue to iteratively process the elements of the tuple, checking if an element is a tuple and, if so, adding its contents back into the data structure to be processed.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Flatten a Nested List**: Given a nested list of integers, write a function to flatten it into a single list with all the integers in the original structure.\n   - Solution: Similar to the tuple problem, we can use recursion or an iterative approach with a stack to process the nested list and extract the integers.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def flatten_nested_list(nested_list):\n         flat_list = []\n         for element in nested_list:\n             if isinstance(element, list):\n                 flat_list.extend(flatten_nested_list(element))\n             else:\n                 flat_list.append(element)\n         return flat_list\n     ```\n\n2. **Deep Count**: Count the total number of elements in a nested list, including all the integers and sub-lists.\n   - Solution: Use recursion to traverse the nested list. For each element, if it is a list, recursively count its elements; otherwise, count it as one.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def deep_count(nested_list):\n         count = 0\n         for element in nested_list:\n             count += 1\n             if isinstance(element, list):\n                 count += deep_count(element)\n         return count\n     ```\n\n3. **Merge Nested Tuples**: Given a list of nested tuples, write a function to merge them into a single flat tuple.\n   - Solution: Iterate through the list of tuples, and for each tuple, flatten it using a similar approach as the original problem, then concatenate the results.\n   - Python3 code:\n     ```python\n     def merge_nested_tuples(tuples_list):\n         merged_tuple = ()\n         for nested_tuple in tuples_list:\n             merged_tuple += flatten_tuple(nested_tuple)\n         return merged_tuple\n     ```\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n- Explanation of the solution:\n  We will use a recursive function to flatten the nested tuple. The function will iterate through each element of the tuple, and if the element is an integer, it will be added to the result. If the element is another tuple, the function will call itself with this inner tuple.\n\n- Python3 code:\n  ```python\n  def remove_nested(test_tup):\n      def flatten_tuple(tup):\n          for item in tup:\n              if isinstance(item, tuple):\n                  yield from flatten_tuple(item)\n              else:\n                  yield item\n      return tuple(flatten_tuple(test_tup))\n\n  # Example usage:\n  nested_tup = (1, (2, (3, 4), 5), 6)\n  print(remove_nested(nested_tup))  # Output: (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)\n  ```\n\nIn the code above, `flatten_tuple` is a generator function that yields flattened elements of the nested tuple.

Binary Search is an efficient algorithm for finding an item from a sorted list of items. It works by repeatedly dividing in half the portion of the list that could contain the item, until you've narrowed down the possible locations to just one.\n\n## Tutorial:\nBinary Search starts with the middle element of a sorted array and compares it with the target value. If the target value matches the middle element, its position is returned. If the target value is less than the middle element, the search continues in the lower half of the array. If the target value is greater, the search continues in the upper half of the array. This process continues, eliminating half of the elements, and comparing the target value with the middle element of the remaining elements, until the target value is found or the subarray reduces to zero.\n\nTo find the last position of an element using Binary Search, we modify the standard algorithm slightly. When we find the element, instead of immediately returning its index, we record the index and continue searching in the right half of the array to see if the element appears again. This ensures that we find the last occurrence of the element.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **First Occurrence of Element in Sorted Array**: Similar to finding the last position, but instead, you find the first occurrence. Modify the binary search to continue in the left half after finding a match.\n\n2. **Find Peak Element**: A peak element is an element that is greater than its neighbors. The problem is to find any peak element in an array where elements are sorted in ascending order, and then in descending order. Binary Search can be used by comparing middle element with its neighbors.\n\n3. **Search in Rotated Sorted Array**: Given a sorted array that has been rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand, the task is to find a particular element. The array can be split into two sorted arrays; Binary Search can be applied with additional conditions to determine which part to search in.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\nWe will implement a modified binary search. We will keep track of the index whenever we find the element `x`. Instead of stopping the search, we will continue to search towards the right side of the array to ensure we find the last occurrence.\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef last(arr: List[int], x: int) -> int:\n    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1\n    result = -1  # Initialize result to -1 to indicate if the element is not found\n    \n    while left <= right:\n        mid = left + (right - left) // 2\n        if arr[mid] == x:\n            result = mid  # Update result and search in the right half\n            left = mid + 1\n        elif arr[mid] < x:\n            left = mid + 1\n        else:\n            right = mid - 1\n    \n    return result\n\n# Example usage:\n# arr = [1, 2, 4, 4, 4, 5, 6]\n# x = 4\n# print(last(arr, x))  # Output: 4\n```\n\nThis code will return the last position of the element `x` in the sorted array `arr`, or -1 if the element is not present in the array."], "prompt_tokens": [209], "completion_tokens": [694], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": true, "task_id": "mbpp_793_last"}

Specifically, we will be using bitwise operations to perform a left rotation on the bits of a given number. Bitwise operations are fundamental in computer science and are used to manipulate individual bits of a binary number.\n\n## Tutorial:\nBitwise operations are operations that directly manipulate bits of a binary number. In Python and many other programming languages, we have several bitwise operators:\n\n- `&` (bitwise AND)\n- `|` (bitwise OR)\n- `^` (bitwise XOR)\n- `~` (bitwise NOT)\n- `<<` (left shift)\n- `>>` (right shift)\n\nFor the problem at hand, we are interested in the left shift `<<` operator, which shifts the bits of a number to the left by a specified number of positions, and the bitwise OR `|` operator, which can be used to combine bits.\n\nWhen we perform a left rotation on a binary number, we shift all bits to the left by a certain number of positions, and the bits that fall off the left end are wrapped around to the right side. In a 32-bit number, if we rotate left by `d` bits, the `d` most significant bits (those on the left) need to be moved to the least significant bit positions (those on the right).\n\nTo achieve this, we can use the left shift operator to shift the number `n` left by `d` positions. However, this will not wrap the bits around. To wrap the bits, we need to take the `d` most significant bits before the shift and then place them at the right end of the number after the shift. We can do this by right shifting the number by `(32 - d)` positions and then using the bitwise OR operator to combine the two shifted numbers.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Right Rotate Bits**: Similar to the left rotate, but instead of rotating left, you rotate the bits to the right. The solution involves right shifting the number and wrapping the least significant bits to the most significant bit positions.\n\n2. **Toggle Bits**: Given a number and a range, toggle the bits in the given range in the binary representation of the number. The solution involves creating a mask with bits set in the given range and then using the XOR operator to toggle the bits.\n\n3. **Count Set Bits**: Given a number, count the number of set bits (bits that are 1) in its binary representation. The solution often involves using bitwise AND operation in a loop or using Brian Kernighan\u2019s Algorithm to count the bits efficiently.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\nTo solve the original problem, we will perform two operations:\n1. Left shift the number `n` by `d` bits.\n2. Right shift the number `n` by `(32 - d)` bits to capture the `d` most significant bits that will be wrapped around.\n3. Combine the results of the two operations using the bitwise OR operator.\n\nHere is the Python3 code:\n\n```python\ndef left_rotate(n: int, d: int) -> int:\n    # Mask to clear bits that exceed 32 bits when left shifted\n    MASK = 0xFFFFFFFF\n    \n    # Left rotate the number by d bits\n    left_rotated_part = (n << d) & MASK\n    \n    # Capture the d most significant bits that will be wrapped around\n    wrapped_bits = n >> (32 - d)\n    \n    # Combine the two parts using bitwise OR\n    result = left_rotated_part | wrapped_bits\n    \n    return result\n\n# Example usage:\nn = 16  # binary: 0001 0000\nd = 3\nprint(bin(left_rotate(n, d)))  # Output should be binary: 1000 0010\n```\n\nThe `MASK` is used to ensure that after the left shift, any bits that exceed the 32-bit boundary are cleared (set to 0). This is necessary because Python integers are not fixed in size and can grow beyond 32 bits when left-shifted."], "prompt_tokens": [212], "completion_tokens": [846], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": true, "task_id": "mbpp_799_left_rotate"}

In Python, strings are immutable sequences of Unicode characters, and there are several methods and techniques to manipulate them. For this specific problem, we can use the following approaches:\n\n1. Iteration and Concatenation: Iterate through each character in the string and concatenate only the non-whitespace characters to a new string.\n2. Built-in `str.replace()` method: Use the `replace()` method to replace all occurrences of a specific substring (in this case, a space character) with another substring (an empty string).\n3. Regular Expressions: Use the `re` module to find and replace patterns in a string, which can be used to remove all whitespace characters using a regular expression pattern.\n4. List Comprehension and `str.join()`: Use a list comprehension to filter out whitespace characters and then join the remaining characters back into a string.\n\n## Tutorial:\n### Iteration and Concatenation:\nYou can iterate through each character in the string using a `for` loop and check if it is a whitespace character using the `isspace()` method. If it is not, you can add it to a new string.\n\n### Built-in `str.replace()` method:\nThe `replace()` method is a string method that takes two arguments: the substring to be replaced and the substring to replace it with. In this case, you would call `text.replace(' ', '')` to replace all spaces with an empty string.\n\n### Regular Expressions:\nThe `re` module in Python provides regular expression operations. To remove all whitespace characters, you can use `re.sub(r'\\s+', '', text)`, where `\\s+` is a pattern that matches any whitespace character, and `''` is the replacement string.\n\n### List Comprehension and `str.join()`:\nA list comprehension can be used to create a list of non-whitespace characters, which can then be joined into a string using the `join()` method. The expression would be `''.join([char for char in text if not char.isspace()])`.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **String Compression**: Given a string, compress it using the counts of repeated characters. For example, \"aabcccccaaa\" would become \"a2b1c5a3\". The solution involves iterating through the string and keeping track of the current character and its count.\n\n2. **Reverse Words in a String**: Given an input string, reverse the string word by word. A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The solution involves splitting the string by spaces, reversing the list of words, and then joining them back together with spaces.\n\n3. **Valid Palindrome**: Given a string, determine if it is a palindrome, considering only alphanumeric characters and ignoring cases.

Check if `x`, `y`, and `z` are all equal. If so, return 3 because all three numbers are the same.\n2. If not, check if `x` equals `y`, or `x` equals `z`, or `y` equals `z`.

The number of rotations is equal to the index of the minimum element in the rotated array.\n\nThe algorithm to find the number of rotations in a sorted rotated array is similar to a binary search algorithm, with modifications to find the pivot point (the point of change from maximum to minimum) which indicates the number of rotations.\n\n## Tutorial:\nBinary search is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that works on a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. If the value of the search key is less than the item in the middle of the interval, narrow the interval to the lower half. Otherwise, narrow it to the upper half. Repeatedly check until the value is found or the interval is empty.\n\nFor finding the number of rotations in a sorted rotated array, we modify the binary search as follows:\n1. Find the middle index of the array.\n2. If the middle element is the minimum (i.e., it is smaller than its previous and next elements), then it is the pivot point, and the number of rotations is equal to the middle index.\n3. If the array's leftmost element is less than or equal to the middle element, then the pivot must be to the right of the middle element. So, we search in the right half of the array.\n4. Otherwise, the pivot must be to the left of the middle element, and we search in the left half of the array.\n5. Repeat the steps until the pivot is found.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Search in Rotated Sorted Array**: Given a rotated sorted array and a target value, search for the target in the array. If found, return its index, otherwise return -1.\n   Solution: Use a modified binary search to first find the pivot where the array is rotated. Then, perform a regular binary search in the appropriate half of the array where the target may be located.\n\n2. **Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array**: Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand. Find the minimum element.\n   Solution: Use a modified binary search to find the pivot, which is the minimum element.\n\n3. **Find Maximum in Rotated Sorted Array**: Similar to finding the minimum, but instead, you need to find the maximum element in a rotated sorted array.\n   Solution: Use a modified binary search to find the pivot, and then the maximum element will be just before the pivot.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\nTo solve the original problem, we will implement a modified binary search to find the index of the minimum element, which will give us the number of rotations.\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef count_rotation(arr: List[int]) -> int:\n    low, high = 0, len(arr) - 1\n    n = len(arr)\n    \n    while low <= high:\n        if arr[low] <= arr[high]:  # Case when the array is already sorted\n            return low\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        next = (mid + 1) % n\n        prev = (mid - 1 + n) % n\n        \n        # Check if mid element is the minimum\n        if arr[mid] <= arr[next] and arr[mid] <= arr[prev]:\n            return mid\n        elif arr[mid] <= arr[high]:  # Pivot is in the left half\n            high = mid - 1\n        else:  # Pivot is in the right half\n            low = mid + 1\n    \n    return 0  # This should never be reached if the array is a rotated sorted array\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(count_rotation([15, 18, 2, 3, 6, 12]))  # Output: 2\nprint(count_rotation([7, 9, 11, 12, 5]))      # Output: 4\n```\n\nThe function `count_rotation` takes a rotated sorted array as input and returns the number of rotations it has undergone to reach the current state.

The core concepts include:\n\n1. **Brute Force Method**: Check all numbers less than or equal to `n/2` by squaring them and comparing the result with `n`.\n2. **Binary Search Method**: Use binary search to find the square root of `n` and check if it is an integer.\n3. **Mathematical Trick (using properties of squares)**: Check if the number is a square by using mathematical properties, such as the fact that the square of an integer ends with certain digits and the sum of the first `n` odd numbers is `n^2`.\n\n## Tutorial:\n### Brute Force Method:\nThis is the simplest method where you iterate from 1 to `n/2` and check if any number squared equals `n`. This method is not efficient for large numbers as it has a time complexity of O(sqrt(n)).\n\n### Binary Search Method:\nBinary search is a much more efficient way to find the square root of a number, which can then be used to check if the number is a perfect square. The idea is to find the middle number `mid` between 1 and `n`, square it, and compare it with `n`. If `mid^2` is less than `n`, we search the upper half, otherwise, we search the lower half. We repeat this process until we find the square root or determine that there is no integer square root.\n\n### Mathematical Trick:\nCertain mathematical properties can be used to quickly rule out numbers that cannot be perfect squares. For example, a perfect square in base 10 cannot end with 2, 3, 7, or 8. Also, the sum of the first `n` odd numbers is `n^2`, which can sometimes be used to determine if a number is a perfect square.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Finding the Next Perfect Square**: Given a number `n`, find the next perfect square greater than `n`. This problem can be solved by first determining if `n` is a perfect square and then finding the next integer after the square root of `n` and squaring it.\n\n2. **Counting Perfect Squares in a Range**: Given a range `[a, b]`, count the number of perfect squares within this range. This can be solved efficiently by finding the square roots of `a` and `b` and then counting the integers between them.\n\n3. **Validating a Magic Square**: A magic square is a grid of numbers where the sums of the numbers in each row, column, and diagonal are the same. One of the conditions for a magic square is that the center number must be a perfect square. This problem involves checking if the center number is a perfect square as part of the validation process.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n### Explanation of the solution:\nWe will use the Binary Search Method to solve this problem efficiently. We will perform a binary search for the square root of `n` and check if we can find an integer square root.\n\n```python\ndef is_perfect_square(n: int) -> bool:\n    if n < 2:\n        return True\n    \n    left, right = 2, n // 2\n    while left <= right:\n        mid = (left + right) // 2\n        squared = mid * mid\n        \n        if squared == n:\n            return True\n        elif squared < n:\n            left = mid + 1\n        else:\n            right = mid - 1\n    \n    return False\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(is_perfect_square(16))  # Output: True\nprint(is_perfect_square(14))  # Output: False\n```\n\nThis code performs a binary search between 2 and `n/2` to find the square root of `n`. If the square of the mid-value is equal to `n`, it returns `True`, indicating that `n` is a perfect square.

The key insight is that the product of any set of numbers is even if and only if at least one of the numbers in the set is even. This is because the multiplication of any number by an even number results in an even product. Therefore, we do not need to actually compute the product of all numbers; we just need to check if there is at least one even number in the list.\n\n## Tutorial:\nWhen dealing with even and odd numbers, the following properties are useful:\n\n1. Even * Even = Even\n2. Even * Odd = Even\n3. Odd * Odd = Odd\n\nGiven these properties, we can deduce that if we have a list of numbers and we want to determine if the product is even or odd, we only need to find one even number to conclude that the product will be even. If all numbers are odd, then the product will be odd.\n\nTo implement this in an algorithm, we can iterate through the list and check each number. If we find an even number, we can immediately return `True` indicating that the product is even. If we reach the end of the list without finding an even number, we return `False`, indicating that the product is odd.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Finding the Parity of a Permutation**: Given a permutation of numbers, determine if the number of inversions is even or odd. The solution involves counting the inversions and checking if the count is even or odd.\n\n2. **Checking for Majority Element**: Given a list of numbers, determine if there is a majority element (an element that appears more than half the time). The solution involves iterating through the list and using a counting mechanism to track the frequency of elements.\n\n3. **Determining if a Matrix has an Inversion**: Given a binary matrix, determine if there is an inversion (a pair of cells such that `matrix[i][j] > matrix[p][q]` for `i < p` and `j < q`).

In the context of this problem, we will use a `for` loop to iterate over the list of numbers.\n\nHere's a brief tutorial on how to use a `for` loop for iteration in Python:\n\n```python\n# Example of iterating over a list using a for loop\nmy_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nfor number in my_list:\n    print(number)  # This will print each number in the list\n```\n\nWhen searching for the first occurrence of an element that satisfies a certain condition (in this case, being an odd number), you can use a `for` loop to go through each element and use an `if` statement to check the condition:\n\n```python\nfor number in my_list:\n    if number % 2 != 0:  # Check if the number is odd\n        print(number)  # This will print the first odd number and exit the loop\n        break  # Exit the loop after finding the first odd number\n```\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Finding the first prime number in a list**: Given a list of integers, find the first prime number.

The solution involves iterating over the list and comparing each element with its neighbors.\n\n3. **Finding the first palindrome number in a list**: Given a list of integers, find the first number that is the same when read forwards and backwards. The solution involves iterating over the list and checking if each number is a palindrome by comparing it to its reverse.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n- Explanation of the solution:\nThe solution involves iterating over the given list of numbers using a `for` loop. For each number, we check if it is odd by using the modulo operator `%`. If a number is odd (`number % 2 != 0`), we return that number immediately, as it is the first odd number in the list.\n\n- Python3 code to solve the problem:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef first_odd(nums: List[int]) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    Write a python function to find the first odd number in a given list of numbers.\n    \"\"\"\n    for number in nums:\n        if number % 2 != 0:  # Check if the number is odd\n            return number  # Return the first odd number found\n    return -1  # Return -1 or some other value if no odd number is found\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(first_odd([2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 3, 5]))  # Output: 3\n```\n\nIn the code above, if no odd number is found, the function returns `-1`.

It's a straightforward search problem where we need to check if a given integer `K` is present in a list of integers `test_tup`. The basic algorithm used here is a linear search.\n\n## Tutorial:\nLinear search is a method for finding a target value within a list. It sequentially checks each element of the list for the target value until a match is found or until all the elements have been searched. Linear search runs in O(n) time, where n is the number of elements in the list. If the target value is present in the list, the linear search returns the index at which it was found. If the target value is not present in the list, the linear search returns an indication that the value was not found (often -1).\n\nHere's a simple example of a linear search algorithm in Python:\n\n```python\ndef linear_search(arr, x):\n    for i in range(len(arr)):\n        if arr[i] == x:\n            return True\n    return False\n```\n\nIn this function, `arr` is the list of elements, and `x` is the target value we're searching for. The function returns `True` if `x` is found in `arr`, and `False` otherwise.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Finding a Duplicate in an Array**: Given an array of integers where each value 1 <= x <= len(array), write a function that finds and returns a duplicate number in the array.\n\n   Solution: You can solve this problem using a linear search by keeping track of numbers you've already seen with a set or list. Iterate through the array, and for each element, check if it's already in the set. If it is, you've found a duplicate.\n\n2. **Checking for Majority Element**: Given an array and a candidate element, check if the candidate is a majority element (appears more than n/2 times).\n\n   Solution: Use a linear search to count the occurrences of the candidate element. If the count exceeds n/2, the candidate is a majority element.\n\n3. **Finding the First Recurring Character**: Given a string, find the first recurring character in it.\n\n   Solution: Use a linear search with a set to keep track of characters you've seen. Iterate through the string, and for each character, check if it's already in the set. If it is, that's the first recurring character.\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\nExplanation of the solution:\nThe solution to the original problem is to iterate through the list `test_tup` and check if `K` is equal to any of the elements. If `K` is found, the function should return `True`. If the end of the list is reached without finding `K`, the function should return `False`.\n\nHere's the Python3 code:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef check_K(test_tup: List[int], K: int) -> bool:\n    # Iterate through each element in the list\n    for num in test_tup:\n        # Check if the current element is equal to K\n        if num == K:\n            # If found, return True\n            return True\n    # If not found, return False\n    return False\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(check_K([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 3))  # Output: True\nprint(check_K([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 6))  # Output: False\n```\n\nThis code will correctly identify whether the integer `K` is present in the list `test_tup`."], "prompt_tokens": [210], "completion_tokens": [760], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": true, "task_id": "mbpp_808_check_K"}

This is a straightforward algorithm that involves iterating over each element in two tuples and comparing them.\n\n## Tutorial:\nElement-wise comparison is a basic operation where you compare corresponding elements of two sequences (like lists, tuples, or arrays). In Python, this can be done using a loop or comprehension. The idea is to iterate over both sequences simultaneously and perform a comparison operation (like `<`, `>`, `==`, etc.) on each pair of elements.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide to performing element-wise comparison in Python:\n\n1. Ensure both sequences are of the same length to avoid `IndexError`.\n2. Use a loop (like `for` or `while`) or a comprehension to iterate over the indices or elements of the sequences.\n3. At each iteration, compare the elements from both sequences.\n4. Depending on the problem, you may need to store the result of each comparison or derive a single result from all comparisons.\n\nFor example, to check if all elements in one list are greater than the corresponding elements in another list, you could do something like this:\n\n```python\ndef all_elements_greater(list1, list2):\n    for i in range(len(list1)):\n        if list1[i] <= list2[i]:\n            return False\n    return True\n```\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Comparing Versions**: Given two version numbers, version1 and version2, compare them.
