{"name": "3554", "description": "Zonk is addictive dice game. In each round player rolls 6 dice. Then (s)he composes combinations from them. Each combination gives certain points. \n\nThen player can take one or more dice combinations to his hand and re-roll remaining dice or save his score. Dice in player's hand won't be taken into account in subsequent rolls.\n\nIf no combinations can be composed - situation is called \"zonk\". Player thrown zonk loses all points in this round and next player moves. So it's player decision when to reroll and when to stop and save his score.\n\nYour task is simple - just evaluate current roll and return maximum number of points can be scored from it. If no combinations can be made - function must return string ``\"Zonk\"`` (without quotes).\n\nThere are different variations of Zonk. In this kata, we will use most common table of combinations:\n\nCombinationExample rollPoints\nStraight (1,2,3,4,5 and 6)6 3 1 2 5 41000 points\nThree pairs of any dice2 2 4 4 1 1750 points\nThree of 11 4 1 11000 points\nThree of 22 3 4 2 2200 points\nThree of 33 4 3 6 3 2300 points\nThree of 44 4 4400 points\nThree of 52 5 5 5 4500 points\nThree of 66 6 2 6600 points\nFour of a kind1 1 1 1 4 62 \u00d7 Three-of-a-kind score (in example, 2000 pts)\nFive of a kind5 5 5 4 5 53 \u00d7 Three-of-a-kind score (in example, 1500 pts)\nSix of a kind4 4 4 4 4 44 \u00d7 Three-of-a-kind score (in example, 1600 pts)\nEvery 14 3 1 2 2100 points\nEvery 55 2 650 points\n\n\nEach die cannot be used in multiple combinations the same time, so three pairs of 2, 3 and 5 will worth you only ``750`` points (for three pairs), not 850 (for three pairs and two fives). But you can select multiple combinations, ``2 2 2 1 6`` will worth you ``300`` points (200 for three-of-kind '2' plus 100 for single '1' die)\n\nExamples:\n```python\n  get_score([1,2,3]) # returns 100 = points from one 1\n  get_score([3,4,1,1,5]) # returns 250 = points from two 1 and one 5\n  get_score([2,3,2,3,3,2]) # returns 500 = three of 2 + three of 3\n  get_score([1,1,1,1,1,5]) # returns 3050 = five 1 + one 5\n  get_score([2,3,4,3,6,6]) # returns \"Zonk\" = no combinations here\n  get_score([2,2,6,6,2,2]) # returns 400 = four 2, this cannot be scored as three pairs\n  get_score([1,3,4,3,4,1]) # returns 750 = three pairs\n  get_score([3,3,3,3]) # returns 600 = four of 3\n  get_score([1,2,3,4,5]) # returns 150 = it's not straight\n```\nOf course, in real Zonk game it's sometimes not worth to collect all combination from roll. Taking less dice and rerolling more remaining may be better, but task is just to calculate maximum possible score from current single roll.\n\nP.S.

Otherwise, we return False.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. **Longest Subsequence**:\n   - Problem: Given two strings, find the length of the longest subsequence present in both of them.\n   - Solution: We can use the same two-pointer approach to iterate through both strings and find the longest subsequence.\n   - Python3 code:\n   ```python\n   def longestSubsequence(str1, str2):\n       i, j = 0, 0\n       while i < len(str1) and j < len(str2):\n           if str1[i] == str2[j]:\n               j += 1\n           i += 1\n       return j == len(str2)\n   ```\n\n2. **String Matching**:\n   - Problem: Given a text string and a pattern string, determine if the pattern appears in the text and return the starting index of the first occurrence.\n   - Solution: We can use the two-pointer approach to iterate through the text and pattern strings and check for a match.\n   - Python3 code:\n   ```python\n   def stringMatching(text, pattern):\n       i, j = 0, 0\n       while i < len(text):\n           if text[i] == pattern[j]:\n               j += 1\n               if j == len(pattern):\n                   return i - j + 1\n           else:\n               j = 0\n           i += 1\n       return -1\n   ```\n\n3. **Smallest Substring**:\n   - Problem: Given a string and a set of characters, find the smallest substring of the string that contains all the characters in the set.\n   - Solution: We can use the two-pointer approach to iterate through the string and find the smallest substring containing all the characters.\n   - Python3 code:\n   ```python\n   def smallestSubstring(s, chars):\n       i, j = 0, 0\n       found = 0\n       min_len = float('inf')\n       for char in s:\n           if char in chars:\n               found += 1\n           while found == len(chars):\n               min_len = min(min_len, j - i + 1)\n               if s[i] in chars:\n                   found -= 1\n               i += 1\n           j += 1\n       return min_len if min_len != float('inf') else 0\n   ```\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n```python\ndef nameInStr(s, name):\n    i, j = 0, 0\n    while i < len(s) and j < len(name):\n        if s[i].lower() == name[j].lower():\n            j += 1\n        i += 1\n    return j == len(name)\n\n# Taking input from standard input\ninput_str = input()\nname = input()\n\n# Calling the function with specified parameters\nresult = nameInStr(input_str, name)\n\n# Printing the output of the function\nprint(result)\n```"], "prompt_tokens": [598], "completion_tokens": [762], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": false, "language": "Python3", "task_id": 3387}

We will represent this in an array. [2, 3] means this creature has a power of 2 and a toughness of 3.\n\nWhen two creatures square off, they each deal damage equal to their power to each other at the same time.

If creature 3 battles creature 4, they both die, as 3 deals 1 damage to 4, but creature 4 only has a toughness of 1.\n\nWrite a function `battle(player1, player2)` that takes in 2 arrays of creatures. Each players' creatures battle each other in order (player1[0] battles the creature in player2[0]) and so on. If one list of creatures is longer than the other, those creatures are considered unblocked, and do not battle.\n\nYour function should return an object (a hash in Ruby) with the keys player1 and player2 that contain the power and toughness of the surviving creatures.\n\nExample:\n```\nGood luck with your battles!\n\n\nCheck out my other Magic The Gathering katas:\n\n\nMagic The Gathering #1: Creatures\nMagic The Gathering #2: Mana", "difficulty": "introductory", "id": 3478, "sample_io": [{"input": "[[2, 3], [1, 4]]\n[[3, 3], [4, 1]]", "output": [{"player1": [], "player2": [[3, 3]]}]}, {"input": "[]\n[]", "output": [{"player1": [], "player2": []}]}], "test_list": [{"input": "[[2, 3], [1, 4]]\n[[3, 3], [4, 1]]", "output": [{"player1": [], "player2": [[3, 3]]}]}, {"input": "[]\n[]", "output": [{"player1": [], "player2": []}]}, {"input": "[[1, 1]]\n[[1, 1]]", "output": [{"player1": [], "player2": []}]}, {"input": "[[2, 1]]\n[[2, 1]]", "output": [{"player1": [], "player2": []}]}, {"input": "[[1, 2]]\n[[1, 2]]", "output": [{"player1": [[1, 2]], "player2": [[1, 2]]}]}, {"input": "[[2, 3]]\n[[3, 2]]", "output": [{"player1": [], "player2": []}]}, {"input": "[[2, 7]]\n[[3, 5]]", "output": [{"player1": [[2, 7]], "player2": [[3, 5]]}]}, {"input": "[[2, 5]]\n[[6, 6]]", "output": [{"player1": [], "player2": [[6, 6]]}]}, {"input": "[[6, 6]]\n[[2, 5]]", "output": [{"player1": [[6, 6]], "player2": []}]}, {"input": "[]\n[[1, 1], [2, 2]]", "output": [{"player1": [], "player2": [[1, 1], [2, 2]]}]}, {"input": "[[1, 1], [2, 2]]\n[]", "output": [{"player1": [[1, 1], [2, 2]], "player2": []}]}, {"input": "[[1, 3], [3, 5], [4, 6], [5, 2]]\n[[2, 4], [6, 1], [4, 4], [3, 7], [3, 1]]", "output": [{"player1": [[1, 3], [4, 6]], "player2": [[2, 4], [3, 7], [3, 1]]}]}], "starter_code": "\ndef battle(player1, player2):\n\t", "source_codes": ["\ndef battle(player1, player2):\n    result = {'player1': [], 'player2': []}\n    for c1, c2 in zip(player1, player2):\n        if c1[0] >= c2[1]:\n            result['player1'].append(c1)\n        if c2[0] >= c1[1]:\n            result['player2'].append(c2)\n    return result\n\n\n"], "responses": ["## Algorithms:\nThe core concept in this problem is to iterate through the creatures of both players and simulate the battles between them.

After applying the rules, we need to revert the characters if they become 'c', 'o', 'd', or 'e' after moving.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. Problem: LeetCode - Replace All Digits with Characters\n   - Given a string s, replace every digit with the letter located that many positions away in the alphabet. If the letter exceeds 'z', start again at 'a'.\n   - Solution: Iterate through the string, check if the character is a digit, and replace it with the letter located that many positions away in the alphabet.\n   - Python3 code:\n   ```python\n   def replaceDigits(s):\n       result = \"\"\n       for i in range(len(s)):\n           if s[i].isdigit():\n               result += chr(ord(s[i-1]) + int(s[i]))\n           else:\n               result += s[i]\n       return result\n   ```\n\n2.

However, you recently contracted a sickness that forced you to stay at home for over a week.  As you see your body getting weaker and weaker every day and as you see your biceps and triceps disappearing, you can't help but lay in bed and cry.

Replace *all* instances of ```\"i am\"``` to ```\"i'm\"```\n3. Replace *all* instances of ```\"instagram\"``` to ```\"insta\"```\n4. Replace *all* instances of ```\"do not\"``` to ```\"don't\"```\n5. Replace *all* instances of ```\"going to\"``` to ```\"gonna\"```\n6. Replace *all* instances of ```\"combination\"``` to ```\"combo\"```\n\nYour replacement regexes **should be case-sensitive**, only replacing the words above with slang if the detected pattern is in **lowercase**.  However, please note that apart from 100% lowercase matches, you will **also have to replace matches that are correctly capitalized** (e.g. ```\"Probably\" => \"Prolly\"``` or ```\"Instagram\" => \"Insta\"```).\n\nFinally, your code will be tested to make sure that you have used **RegExp** replace in your code.\n\nEnjoy :D", "difficulty": "introductory", "id": 3884, "sample_io": [{"input": "When I miss few days of gym", "output": ["When I miss few days of gym"]}, {"input": "Squad probably think I am fake", "output": ["Squad prolly think I'm fake"]}], "test_list": [{"input": "When I miss few days of gym", "output": ["When I miss few days of gym"]}, {"input": "Squad probably think I am fake", "output": ["Squad prolly think I'm fake"]}, {"input": "Whole squad probably bigger than me now", "output": ["Whole squad prolly bigger than me now"]}, {"input": "No selfie to post on Instagram either", "output": ["No selfie to post on Insta either"]}, {"input": "Gym crush probably found someone else", "output": ["Gym crush prolly found someone else"]}, {"input": "What if I die fat", "output": ["What if I die fat"]}, {"input": "What if I do not fit in my clothes now", "output": ["What if I don't fit in my clothes now"]}, {"input": "Going to feel like a new gym member", "output": ["Gonna feel like a new gym member"]}, {"input": "wait what was my lock combination", "output": ["wait what was my lock combo"]}, {"input": "that skinny girl can probably outlift me now", "output": ["that skinny girl can prolly outlift me now"]}, {"input": "probably Probably", "output": ["prolly Prolly"]}, {"input": "i am I am", "output": ["i'm I'm"]}, {"input": "instagram Instagram", "output": ["insta Insta"]}, {"input": "do not Do not", "output": ["don't Don't"]}, {"input": "going to Going to", "output": ["gonna Gonna"]}, {"input": "combination Combination", "output": ["combo Combo"]}, {"input": "probably Probably probably Probably probably Probably probably Probably probably Probably", "output": ["prolly Prolly prolly Prolly prolly Prolly prolly Prolly prolly Prolly"]}, {"input": "i am I am i am I am i am I am i am I am i am I am i am I am", "output": ["i'm I'm i'm I'm i'm I'm i'm I'm i'm I'm i'm I'm"]}, {"input": "instagram Instagram instagram Instagram instagram Instagram instagram Instagram instagram Instagram", "output": ["insta Insta insta Insta insta Insta insta Insta insta Insta"]}, {"input": "do not Do not do not Do not do not Do not do not Do not", "output": ["don't Don't don't Don't don't Don't don't Don't"]}, {"input": "Going to going to Going to Going to going to Going to Going to going to Going to", "output": ["Gonna gonna Gonna Gonna gonna Gonna Gonna gonna Gonna"]}, {"input": "combination combination Combination combination Combination", "output": ["combo combo Combo combo Combo"]}], "starter_code": "\ndef gym_slang(phrase):\n\t", "source_codes": ["\nimport re\n\ndef gymSlang(text):\n    replacements = {\n        \"probably\": \"prolly\",\n        \"i am\": \"i'm\",\n        \"instagram\": \"insta\",\n        \"do not\": \"don't\",\n        \"going to\": \"gonna\",\n        \"combination\": \"combo\"\n    }\n    pattern = re.compile(r'\\b' + r'\\b|\\b'.join(replacements.keys()) + r'\\b')\n    result = pattern.sub(lambda x: replacements[x.group()], text)\n    return result\n\n# Test the function\ninput_text = input(\"Enter the text: \")\nprint(gymSlang(input_text))\n\n\n"], "responses": ["## Algorithms:\nThe core concept in this problem is to use regular expressions to replace specific words with their slang versions.

These operations are often used in low-level programming, cryptography, and competitive programming.\n\nTo calculate the sum of the ASCII values of the input characters, we can iterate through the characters of the string and use the ord() function to get the ASCII value of each character.

(You're not going to bother with other types of color codes just now because you don't think they will come up.) If the color is too yellow, your function needs to return a green or blue-green shade instead, but if it is not too yellow, it needs to return the original color name or hex color code unchanged.\n\n### HTML Color Names\n(If don't know what HTML color names are, take a look at this HTML colors names reference.)\n\nFor HMTL color names, you are going to start out trying a pretty strict definition of yellow, replacing any of the following colors as specified:\n\n~~~~\nGold => ForestGreen\nKhaki => LimeGreen\nLemonChiffon => PaleGreen\nLightGoldenRodYellow => SpringGreen\nLightYellow => MintCream\nPaleGoldenRod => LightGreen\nYellow => Lime\n~~~~\n\nHTML color names are case-insensitive, so your function will need to be able to identify the above yellow shades regardless of the cases used, but should output the green shades as capitalized above.\n\nSome examples:\n```\n\"lemonchiffon\"    \"PaleGreen\"\n\"GOLD\"            \"ForestGreen\"\n\"pAlEgOlDeNrOd\"   \"LightGreen\"\n\"BlueViolet\"      \"BlueViolet\"\n```\n\n### Hex Color Codes\n(If you don't know what six-digit hex color codes are, take a look at this Wikipedia description. Basically the six digits are made up of three two-digit numbers in base 16, known as hexidecimal or hex, from 00 to FF (equivalent to 255 in base 10, also known as decimal), with the first two-digit number specifying the color's red value, the second the green value, and the third blue.)\n\nWith six-digit color hex codes, you are going to start out going really overboard, interpreting as \"yellow\" any hex code where the red (R) value and the green (G) value are each greater than the blue (B) value. When you find one of these \"yellow\" hex codes, your function will take the three hex values and rearrange them that the largest goes to G, the middle goes to B, and the smallest to R. \n\nFor example, with the six-digit hex color code `#FFD700`, which has an R value of hex FF (decimal 255), a G value of hex D7 (decimal 215), and a B value of hex 00 (decimal 0), as the R and G values are each larger than the B value, you would return it as `#00FFD7` -- the FF reassigned to G, the D7 to B, and the 00 to R. \n\nHex color codes are also case-insensitive, but your function should output them in the same case they were received in, just for consistency with whatever style is being used.\n\nSome examples:\n```\n\"#000000\"   \"#000000\"\n\"#b8860b\"   \"#0bb886\"\n\"#8FBC8F\"   \"#8FBC8F\"\n\"#C71585\"   \"#C71585\"\n```", "difficulty": "introductory", "id": 4391, "sample_io": [{"input": "lemonchiffon", "output": ["PaleGreen"]}, {"input": "GOLD", "output": ["ForestGreen"]}], "test_list": [{"input": "lemonchiffon", "output": ["PaleGreen"]}, {"input": "GOLD", "output": ["ForestGreen"]}, {"input": "pAlEgOlDeNrOd", "output": ["LightGreen"]}, {"input": "BlueViolet", "output": ["BlueViolet"]}, {"input": "#000000", "output": ["#000000"]}, {"input": "#b8860b", "output": ["#0bb886"]}, {"input": "#8FBC8F", "output": ["#8FBC8F"]}, {"input": "#C71585", "output": ["#C71585"]}], "starter_code": "\ndef yellow_be_gone(s):\n\t", "source_codes": ["\ndef replace_yellow_color(color):\n    html_color_mapping = {\n        \"gold\": \"ForestGreen\",\n        \"khaki\": \"LimeGreen\",\n        \"lemonchiffon\": \"PaleGreen\",\n        \"lightgoldenrodyellow\": \"SpringGreen\",\n        \"lightyellow\": \"MintCream\",\n        \"palegoldenrod\": \"LightGreen\",\n        \"yellow\": \"Lime\"\n    }\n    \n    if color[0] == \"#\":  # Hex color code\n        r = int(color[1:3], 16)\n        g = int(color[3:5], 16)\n        b = int(color[5:], 16)\n        if r > b and g > b:\n            return f\"#{color[5:]}{color[3:5]}{color[1:3]}\".upper()\n        else:\n            return color\n    else:  # HTML color name\n        return html_color_mapping[color.lower()] if color.lower() in html_color_mapping else color\n\n# Sample Input\ncolor_input = \"lemonchiffon\"\n# Function Call\nprint(replace_yellow_color(color_input))\n\n\n"], "responses": ["## Algorithms:\nThe core concept to solve this problem is to identify whether the given color is too yellow or not.

Note that  `a <= range <= b` and `b` will not exceed `500000`.\n\nGood luck!\n\nIf you like this Kata, you will enjoy:\n\n[Simple Prime Streaming](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5a908da30025e995880000e3)\n\n[Sum of prime-indexed elements](https://www.codewars.com/kata/59f38b033640ce9fc700015b)\n\n[Divisor harmony](https://www.codewars.com/kata/59bf97cd4f98a8b1cd00007e)", "difficulty": "introductory", "id": 3856, "sample_io": [{"input": "0\n10", "output": [8]}, {"input": "2\n200", "output": [1080]}], "test_list": [{"input": "0\n10", "output": [8]}, {"input": "2\n200", "output": [1080]}, {"input": "200\n2000", "output": [48132]}, {"input": "500\n10000", "output": [847039]}, {"input": "1000\n100000", "output": [52114889]}, {"input": "2000\n200000", "output": [183035206]}, {"input": "3000\n400000", "output": [650120994]}, {"input": "4000\n500000", "output": [972664400]}], "starter_code": "\ndef solve(a,b):\n\t", "source_codes": ["\ndef sum_of_dominant_primes(a, b):\n    # Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to generate prime numbers\n    primes = [True] * (b + 1)\n    primes[0], primes[1] = False, False\n    p = 2\n    while p * p <= b:\n        if primes[p]:\n            for i in range(p * p, b + 1, p):\n                primes[i] = False\n        p += 1\n    \n    # Calculate the sum of prime numbers at prime-numbered positions\n    prime_sum = 0\n    for i in range(a, b + 1):\n        if primes[i]:\n            prime_sum += i\n    \n    return prime_sum\n\n# Take input from standard input\na = int(input())\nb = int(input())\n# Call the function with specified parameters\nresult = sum_of_dominant_primes(a, b)\n# Print the output of the function\nprint(result)\n\n\n"], "responses": ["## Algorithms:\nTo solve this problem, we need to:\n1.

Merge the two sorted halves and count the number of inversions.\n\nThe key idea is that when merging the two sorted halves, if we encounter an element from the right half that is smaller than an element from the left half, then we have found an inversion. We can count the number of inversions by keeping track of the number of elements remaining in the left half when we encounter an element from the right half that is smaller.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. Problem: Count Inversions\n   - Given an array of integers, count the number of inversions in the array.\n   - Solution: Use the merge sort algorithm to count the inversions while merging the two sorted halves.\n   - Python3 code:\n   ```python\n   def count_inversions(arr):\n       def merge(left, right):\n           result = []\n           count = 0\n           i, j = 0, 0\n           while i < len(left) and j < len(right):\n               if left[i] <= right[j]:\n                   result.append(left[i])\n                   i += 1\n               else:\n                   result.append(right[j])\n                   j += 1\n                   count += len(left) - i\n           result += left[i:]\n           result += right[j:]\n           return result, count\n       \n       def merge_sort(arr):\n           if len(arr) <= 1:\n               return arr, 0\n           mid = len(arr) // 2\n           left, count_left = merge_sort(arr[:mid])\n           right, count_right = merge_sort(arr[mid:])\n           merged, count = merge(left, right)\n           return merged, count + count_left + count_right\n       \n       _, inversions = merge_sort(arr)\n       return inversions\n   ```\n\n2. Problem: Count Triplets\n   - Given an array of integers, count the number of triplets (i, j, k) such that i < j < k and arr[i] > arr[j] > arr[k].\n   - Solution: Use the merge sort algorithm to count the inversions while merging the two sorted halves, and modify the merge step to count the number of triplets.\n   - Python3 code:\n   ```python\n   def count_triplets(arr):\n       def merge(left, right):\n           result = []\n           count = 0\n           i, j = 0, 0\n           while i < len(left) and j < len(right):\n               if left[i] > right[j]:\n                   count += len(left) - i\n                   result.append(right[j])\n                   j += 1\n               else:\n                   result.append(left[i])\n                   i += 1\n           result += left[i:]\n           result += right[j:]\n           return result, count\n       \n       def merge_sort(arr):\n           if len(arr) <= 1:\n               return arr, 0\n           mid = len(arr) // 2\n           left, count_left = merge_sort(arr[:mid])\n           right, count_right = merge_sort(arr[mid:])\n           merged, count = merge(left, right)\n           return merged, count + count_left + count_right\n       \n       _, inversions = merge_sort(arr)\n       return inversions\n   ```\n\n3. Problem: Count Smaller Elements After Self\n   - Given an array of integers, for each element, count the number of elements to the right that are smaller than the current element.\n   - Solution: Use the merge sort algorithm to count the inversions while merging the two sorted halves, and modify the merge step to count the number of smaller elements after self.\n   - Python3 code:\n   ```python\n   def count_smaller_elements(arr):\n       def merge(left, right):\n           result = []\n           count = 0\n           i, j = 0, 0\n           while i < len(left) and j < len(right):\n               if left[i] > right[j]:\n                   result.append(left[i])\n                   i += 1\n               else:\n                   result.append(right[j])\n                   j += 1\n                   count += len(left) - i\n           result += left[i:]\n           result += right[j:]\n           return result, count\n       \n       def merge_sort(arr):\n           if len(arr) <= 1:\n               return arr, 0\n           mid = len(arr) // 2\n           left, count_left = merge_sort(arr[:mid])\n           right, count_right = merge_sort(arr[mid:])\n           merged, count = merge(left, right)\n           return merged, count + count_left + count_right\n       \n       _, inversions = merge_sort(arr)\n       return inversions\n   ```\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n```python\ndef count_inversion(arr):\n    def merge(left, right):\n        result = []\n        count = 0\n        i, j = 0, 0\n        while i < len(left) and j < len(right):\n            if left[i] <= right[j]:\n                result.append(left[i])\n                i += 1\n            else:\n                result.append(right[j])\n                j += 1\n                count += len(left) - i\n        result += left[i:]\n        result += right[j:]\n        return result, count\n    \n    def merge_sort(arr):\n        if len(arr) <= 1:\n            return arr, 0\n        mid = len(arr) // 2\n        left, count_left = merge_sort(arr[:mid])\n        right, count_right = merge_sort(arr[mid:])\n        merged, count = merge(left, right)\n        return merged, count + count_left + count_right\n    \n    _, inversions = merge_sort(arr)\n    return inversions\n\n# Read input from standard input\narr = tuple(map(int, input().split(',')))\nprint(count_inversion(arr))\n```"], "prompt_tokens": [492], "completion_tokens": [1307], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": false, "language": "Python3", "task_id": 3562}

Problem: Highest Divisor\n   - Given a number N, find the highest divisor of N.\n   - Solution: Iterate from 1 to the square root of N, and for each divisor found, update the highest divisor.\n   - Python3 code:\n   ```python\n   def highest_divisor(N):\n       highest = 1\n       for i in range(2, int(N**0.5) + 1):\n           if N % i == 0:\n               highest = max(highest, i, N//i)\n       return highest\n   ```\n\n2. Problem: Sum of Factors\n   - Given a number N, find the sum of all its factors.\n   - Solution: Iterate from 1 to the square root of N, and for each divisor found, add it to the sum. Also, add the result of the division if the divisor is not the square root of N.\n   - Python3 code:\n   ```python\n   def sum_of_factors(N):\n       total = 0\n       for i in range(1, int(N**0.5) + 1):\n           if N % i == 0:\n               total += i\n               if i != N//i:\n                   total += N//i\n       return total\n   ```\n\n3. Problem: Kth Factor\n   - Given a number N and an index K, find the Kth factor of N.\n   - Solution: Iterate from 1 to the square root of N, and for each divisor found, decrement K. If K becomes 0, return the current divisor. Also, consider the result of the division if the divisor is not the square root of N.\n   - Python3 code:\n   ```python\n   def kth_factor(N, K):\n       for i in range(1, int(N**0.5) + 1):\n           if N % i == 0:\n               K -= 1\n               if K == 0:\n                   return i\n               if i != N//i:\n                   K -= 1\n                   if K == 0:\n                       return N//i\n       return -1\n   ```\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n- Explanation of the solution: \n  - We will iterate from 1 to the square root of the given number and add the divisors and the result of the division to a list. Then we will sort the list in descending order and return it.\n\n- Python3 code:\n```python\ndef factors(num):\n    if not isinstance(num, int) or num < 1:\n        return -1\n    factor_list = []\n    for i in range(1, int(num**0.5) + 1):\n        if num % i == 0:\n            factor_list.append(i)\n            if i != num//i:\n                factor_list.append(num//i)\n    factor_list.sort(reverse=True)\n    return factor_list\n```"], "prompt_tokens": [335], "completion_tokens": [707], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": false, "language": "Python3", "task_id": 3836}

The first digit is cleanly divisible by `1`, the first two digits are cleanly divisible by `2`, the first three by `3` and so on.\n\nThe interesting thing about polydivisiblity is that it relates to the underlying number, but not the base it is written in, so if aliens came to Earth and used base `23` (`11` fingers on one hand and `12` on the other), no matter what squiggles they use to write numbers, they would find the same numbers polydivisible!\n\n### Polydivisibilty Example:\n\nLet's do a worked example to clear up any questions ...\n\nStarting wih the number `1,232` in base `10` then:\n\n```\n 1232\n 1    /1 = 1    Yay!\n 12   /2 = 6    Yay!\n 123  /3 = 41   Yay!\n 1232 /4 = 308  Yay!\n```\n\nThus `1,232` is a polydivisible number in base `4` and above.\n\nHowever starting wih the number `123,220` and using base `10` then:\n\n```\n 123220\n 1      /1 = 1            Yay!\n 12     /2 = 6            Yay!\n 123    /3 = 41           Yay!\n 1232   /4 = 308          Yay!\n 12322  /5 = 2464.4       Oh no, that's not a round number!\n 123220 /6 = 220536.333r  Oh no, that's not a round number!\n```\n\nThus `123,220` is not a polydivisible base 10 number, but what about in another base?\n\nAgain starting wih the number `123,220` and using base `6` then:\n\n```\n base 6   base 10\n 1      = 1       -> 1     /1 = 1     Yay!\n 12     = 8       -> 8     /2 = 4     Yay!\n 123    = 51      -> 51    /3 = 17    Yay!\n 1232   = 308     -> 308   /4 = 77    Yay!\n 12322  = 1850    -> 1850  /5 = 370   Yay!\n 123220 = 11100   -> 11100 /6 = 1850  Yay!\n```\n\nThus `123,220` is a polydivisible base `6` number (and a polydivisible base `10` number when converted to `11100` in base `10`).\n\n### Kata\n\nIn this kata you must implement two methods: `is_polydivisible(n, b)` and `get_polydivisible(n, b)`.\n\nThe first `is_polydivisible(n, b)` will return `True` if `n` is polydivisible in base `b` or `False` if not.\n\nThe second `get_polydivisible(n, b)` will return the `n`th polydivisible number using base `b`, the first polydivisible number is of course always `0`.\n\nYou can assume that all inputs are valid.\n\n```if:haskell\nAll necessary arithmetic can be done in `Int` range.\n```\n\n### Kata Examples:\n\n```python\n    is_polydivisible(\"1232\", 10)   # => True\n    is_polydivisible(\"123220\", 10) # => False\n    is_polydivisible(\"123220\", 6)  # => True\n    get_polydivisible(22, 10)      # => \"32\"\n    get_polydivisible(22, 16)      # => \"1A\"\n    get_polydivisible(42, 16)      # => \"42\"\n```\n\n#### A Note on Bases\n\nThe maximum base used is base `62`, and uses characters in the following order `[0-9][A-Z][a-z]` to denote its digits, base `n` will use the first `n` characters of this sequence.\n```if-not:haskell\nA constant CHARS has been declared with this sequence for you.\n```", "difficulty": "interview", "id": 1627, "sample_io": [{"input": "123\n10", "output": [true]}, {"input": "1234\n10", "output": [false]}], "test_list": [{"input": "123\n10", "output": [true]}, {"input": "1234\n10", "output": [false]}, {"input": "12345\n10", "output": [false]}, {"input": "12365\n10", "output": [true]}, {"input": "123220\n10", "output": [false]}, {"input": "50041\n6", "output": [true]}, {"input": "140410\n6", "output": [true]}, {"input": "203230\n6", "output": [true]}, {"input": "30043052\n6", "output": [true]}], "starter_code": "\ndef is_polydivisible(s, b):\n\t", "source_codes": ["\ndef is_polydivisible(n, b):\n    num = int(n, b)\n    for i in range(1, len(n) + 1):\n        if num % i != 0:\n            return False\n    return True\n\ndef get_polydivisible(n, b):\n    count = 0\n    num = 0\n    while count < n:\n        if is_polydivisible(str(num), b):\n            count += 1\n        if count == n:\n            return str(num)\n        num += 1\n\n\n"], "responses": ["## Algorithms:\nThe core concept in this problem is to check if a number is polydivisible in a given base and to find the nth polydivisible number in a given base.

{"name": "1663", "description": "In this Kata we focus on finding a sum S(n) which is the total number of divisors taken for all natural numbers less or equal to n. More formally, we investigate the sum of n components denoted by d(1) + d(2) + ... + d(n) in which for any i starting from 1 up to n the value of d(i) tells us how many distinct numbers divide i without a remainder. \n\nYour solution should work for possibly large values of n without a timeout.\nAssume n to be greater than zero and not greater than 999 999 999 999 999.\nBrute force approaches will not be feasible options in such cases. It is fairly simple to conclude that for every n>1 there holds a recurrence S(n) = S(n-1) + d(n) with initial case S(1) = 1.\n\nFor example:\nS(1) = 1\nS(2) = 3\nS(3) = 5\nS(4) = 8\nS(5) = 10\n\nBut is the fact useful anyway? If you find it is rather not, maybe this will help: \n\nTry to convince yourself that for any natural k, the number S(k) is the same as the number of pairs (m,n) that solve the inequality mn <= k in natural numbers.\nOnce it becomes clear, we can think of a partition of all the solutions into classes just by saying that a pair (m,n) belongs to the class indexed by n.\nThe question now arises if it is possible to count solutions of n-th class. If f(n) stands for the number of solutions that belong to n-th class, it means that S(k) = f(1) + f(2) + f(3) + ...\n\nThe reasoning presented above leads us to some kind of a formula for S(k), however not necessarily the most efficient one.

{"name": "1654", "description": "To give credit where credit is due: This problem was taken from the ACMICPC-Northwest Regional Programming Contest. Thank you problem writers.\n\nYou are helping an archaeologist decipher some runes. He knows that this ancient society used a Base 10 system, and that they never start a number with a leading zero. He's figured out most of the digits as well as a few operators, but he needs your help to figure out the rest.\n\nThe professor will give you a simple math expression, of the form\n\n```\n[number][op][number]=[number]\n```\n\nHe has converted all of the runes he knows into digits. The only operators he knows are addition (`+`),subtraction(`-`), and multiplication (`*`), so those are the only ones that will appear. Each number will be in the range from -1000000 to 1000000, and will consist of only the digits 0-9, possibly a leading -, and maybe a few ?s. If there are ?s in an expression, they represent a digit rune that the professor doesn't know (never an operator, and never a leading -). All of the ?s in an expression will represent the same digit (0-9), and it won't be one of the other given digits in the expression. No number will begin with a 0 unless the number itself is  0, therefore 00 would not be a valid number. \n\nGiven an expression, figure out the value of the rune represented by the question mark. If more than one digit works, give the lowest one. If no digit works, well, that's bad news for the professor - it means that he's got some of his runes wrong. output -1 in that case.\n\nComplete the method to solve the expression to find the value of the unknown rune. The method takes a string as a paramater repressenting the expression and will return an int value representing the unknown rune or -1 if no such rune exists.\n\n~~~if:php\n**Most of the time, the professor will be able to figure out most of the runes himself, but sometimes, there may be exactly 1 rune present in the expression that the professor cannot figure out (resulting in all question marks where the digits are in the expression) so be careful ;)**\n~~~", "difficulty": "interview", "id": 1654, "sample_io": [{"input": "123?45*?=?", "output": [0]}, {"input": "?*123?45=?", "output": [0]}], "test_list": [{"input": "123?45*?=?", "output": [0]}, {"input": "?*123?45=?", "output": [0]}, {"input": "??605*-63=-73???5", "output": [1]}, {"input": "123?45+?=123?45", "output": [0]}, {"input": "?8?170-1?6256=7?2?14", "output": [9]}, {"input": "?38???+595???=833444", "output": [2]}, {"input": "123?45-?=123?45", "output": [0]}, {"input": "-7715?5--484?00=-28?9?5", "output": [6]}, {"input": "50685?--1?5630=652?8?", "output": [4]}, {"input": "??+??=??", "output": [-1]}, {"input": "-?56373--9216=-?47157", "output": [8]}], "starter_code": "\ndef solve_runes(runes):\n\t", "source_codes": ["\ndef evaluateExpression(exp):\n    for i in range(10):\n        num = exp.replace('?', str(i))\n        if num[0] != '0' and eval(num[:-2]) == int(num[-1]):\n            return i\n    return -1\n\n# Take input from standard input\nexpression = input()\n# Call the function with the input parameter and print the output\nprint(evaluateExpression(expression))\n\n\n"], "responses": ["## Algorithms:\nThe core concept to solve this problem is to iterate through all the possible digits (0-9) and check if the given expression is valid for that digit.

If the sum becomes equal to the target, we can count it as a valid combination.\n   - Python3 code:\n   ```python\n   def combinationSum(candidates, target):\n       def backtrack(start, path, target):\n           if target < 0:\n               return\n           if target == 0:\n               res.append(path)\n               return\n           for i in range(start, len(candidates)):\n               backtrack(i, path + [candidates[i]], target - candidates[i])\n       res = []\n       backtrack(0, [], target)\n       return res\n   ```\n\n3. Problem: Factor Combinations\n   - Given a positive integer, break it into the sum of at least two positive integers and maximize the product of those integers. Return all possible combinations.\n   - Solution: We can use a recursive approach to find all the combinations of positive integers that multiply to the given integer. We can start with an empty list and keep adding numbers to it until the product of the list equals the given integer. If the length of the list becomes 2 or more and the product is the given integer, we can count it as a valid combination.\n   - Python3 code:\n   ```python\n   def getFactors(n):\n       def backtrack(start, path, n):\n           for i in range(start, int(n**0.5) + 1):\n               if n % i == 0:\n                   res.append(path + [i, n//i])\n                   backtrack(i, path + [i], n//i)\n           return res\n       res = []\n       return backtrack(2, [], n)\n   ```\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n```python\ndef countCombinations(n, k):\n    def backtrack(start, path, n, k):\n        if n == 1 and len(path) == k:\n            nonlocal count\n            count += 1\n            return\n        for i in range(start, n + 1):\n            if n % i == 0:\n                backtrack(i, path + [i], n // i, k)\n    count = 0\n    backtrack(1, [], n, k)\n    return count\n\n# take input\nn = int(input())\nk = int(input())\n# call the function and print the output\nprint(countCombinations(n, k))\n```"], "prompt_tokens": [564], "completion_tokens": [875], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": false, "language": "Python3", "task_id": 1642}

We can start by checking if both inputs are arrays, and if not, return False. Then, we compare the lengths of the arrays. If they are not equal, we return False. If they are equal, we recursively call the same function on each pair of elements in the arrays until we reach the base case, which is when we encounter non-array elements.

It involves finding the number of ways to make change for a particular amount using the given denominations of coins. The problem can be solved using dynamic programming by building a table to store the number of ways to make change for each amount using the given denominations.\n\nThe steps to solve the \"Coin Change\" problem are as follows:\n1. Create a table to store the number of ways to make change for each amount from 0 to the target amount.\n2. Initialize the table with base cases: there is 1 way to make change for 0 amount.\n3. Iterate through the denominations and update the table for each denomination by adding the number of ways to make change for the current amount minus the denomination.\n4. The final answer will be stored in the table at the target amount.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1.

This can be achieved by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all the elements in the array and then finding the sum of the array after dividing each element by the GCD.\n\n## Tutorial:\nThe algorithm used in this problem is based on the concept of finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of a set of numbers. The GCD of two numbers a and b is the largest positive integer that divides both a and b without leaving a remainder. \n\nTo find the GCD of a set of numbers, we can use the Euclidean algorithm. The Euclidean algorithm is based on the principle that the GCD of two numbers does not change if the larger number is replaced by its difference with the smaller number. This process is repeated until the two numbers are equal, at which point the GCD is found.\n\nOnce we have the GCD of the array, we can divide each element of the array by the GCD and then return the sum of the modified array as the result.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1.

Problem: Array Manipulation\n   - Description: Given an array of integers and a set of queries, each query is represented by a triplet (a, b, k) and requires adding the value k to all the elements in the array between the indices a and b (inclusive).\n   - Solution: We can use the concept of prefix sum to efficiently perform the operations for each query.

Same goes for all the numbers up to 109, while 110 is again a decreasing number.\n\nNow your task is rather easy to declare (a bit less to perform): you have to build a function to return the total occurrences of all the increasing or decreasing numbers *below* 10 raised to the xth power (x will always be >= 0).\n\nTo give you a starting point, there are a grand total of increasing and decreasing numbers as shown in the table:\n\n|Total  | Below\n|---------------\n|1      | 1\n|10     | 10\n|100    | 100\n|475    | 1000\n|1675   | 10000\n|4954   | 100000\n|12952  | 1000000\n\nThis means that your function will have to behave like this:\n```python\ntotal_inc_dec(0)==1\ntotal_inc_dec(1)==10\ntotal_inc_dec(2)==100\ntotal_inc_dec(3)==475\ntotal_inc_dec(4)==1675\ntotal_inc_dec(5)==4954\ntotal_inc_dec(6)==12952\n```\n\n**Tips:** efficiency and trying to figure out how it works are essential: with a brute force approach, some tests with larger numbers may take more than the total computing power currently on Earth to be finished in the short allotted time.\n\nTo make it even clearer, the increasing or decreasing numbers between in the range 101-200 are: [110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 155, 156, 157, 158, 159, 166, 167, 168, 169, 177, 178, 179, 188, 189, 199, 200], that is 47 of them.

By breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems and storing the results, we can efficiently calculate the total occurrences.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. Problem: Count Numbers\n   You are given a number n. You need to count the total numbers from 1 to n which are either increasing or decreasing.\n   Solution:\n   We can use dynamic programming to solve this problem. We can calculate the count of increasing and decreasing numbers for each digit and then sum them up to get the total count.\n   ```python\n   def countNumbers(n):\n       dp = [[0 for _ in range(10)] for _ in range(10)]\n       for i in range(10):\n           dp[0][i] = 1\n       for i in range(1, 10):\n           for j in range(10):\n               for k in range(j, 10):\n                   dp[i][j] += dp[i - 1][k]\n       total = 0\n       for i in range(1, len(str(n))):\n           for j in range(1, 10):\n               total += dp[i][j]\n       return total\n   ```\n\n2. Problem: Bouncy Numbers\n   Given a number n, you need to find the nth bouncy number. A bouncy number is a number that is neither increasing nor decreasing.\n   Solution:\n   We can use dynamic programming to solve this problem. We can iterate through the numbers and check if they are bouncy. Once we find the nth bouncy number, we return it.\n   ```python\n   def bouncyNumbers(n):\n       count = 0\n       num = 99\n       while count < n:\n           num += 1\n           if not (num == int(''.join(sorted(str(num)))) or num == int(''.join(sorted(str(num), reverse=True)))):\n               count += 1\n       return num\n   ```\n\n3. Problem: Increasing Subsequences\n   Given an array of integers, you need to find the total number of increasing subsequences in the array.\n   Solution:\n   We can use dynamic programming to solve this problem.

{"name": "1627", "description": "### Background\n\nI was reading a [book](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Things-Make-Do-Fourth-Dimension/dp/1846147646/) recently, \"Things to Make and Do in the Fourth Dimension\" by comedian and mathematician Matt Parker, and in the first chapter of the book Matt talks about problems he likes to solve in his head to take his mind off the fact that he is in his dentist's chair, we've all been there!\n\nThe problem he talks about relates to polydivisible numbers, and I thought a kata should be written on the subject as it's quite interesting. (Well it's interesting to me, so there!)\n\n### Polydivisib... huh what?\n\nSo what are they?\n\nA polydivisible number is divisible in an unusual way. The first digit is cleanly divisible by `1`, the first two digits are cleanly divisible by `2`, the first three by `3` and so on.\n\nThe interesting thing about polydivisiblity is that it relates to the underlying number, but not the base it is written in, so if aliens came to Earth and used base `23` (`11` fingers on one hand and `12` on the other), no matter what squiggles they use to write numbers, they would find the same numbers polydivisible!\n\n### Polydivisibilty Example:\n\nLet's do a worked example to clear up any questions ...\n\nStarting wih the number `1,232` in base `10` then:\n\n```\n 1232\n 1    /1 = 1    Yay!\n 12   /2 = 6    Yay!\n 123  /3 = 41   Yay!\n 1232 /4 = 308  Yay!\n```\n\nThus `1,232` is a polydivisible number in base `4` and above.\n\nHowever starting wih the number `123,220` and using base `10` then:\n\n```\n 123220\n 1      /1 = 1            Yay!\n 12     /2 = 6            Yay!\n 123    /3 = 41           Yay!\n 1232   /4 = 308          Yay!\n 12322  /5 = 2464.4       Oh no, that's not a round number!\n 123220 /6 = 220536.333r  Oh no, that's not a round number!\n```\n\nThus `123,220` is not a polydivisible base 10 number, but what about in another base?\n\nAgain starting wih the number `123,220` and using base `6` then:\n\n```\n base 6   base 10\n 1      = 1       -> 1     /1 = 1     Yay!\n 12     = 8       -> 8     /2 = 4     Yay!\n 123    = 51      -> 51    /3 = 17    Yay!\n 1232   = 308     -> 308   /4 = 77    Yay!\n 12322  = 1850    -> 1850  /5 = 370   Yay!\n 123220 = 11100   -> 11100 /6 = 1850  Yay!\n```\n\nThus `123,220` is a polydivisible base `6` number (and a polydivisible base `10` number when converted to `11100` in base `10`).\n\n### Kata\n\nIn this kata you must implement two methods: `is_polydivisible(n, b)` and `get_polydivisible(n, b)`.\n\nThe first `is_polydivisible(n, b)` will return `True` if `n` is polydivisible in base `b` or `False` if not.\n\nThe second `get_polydivisible(n, b)` will return the `n`th polydivisible number using base `b`, the first polydivisible number is of course always `0`.\n\nYou can assume that all inputs are valid.\n\n```if:haskell\nAll necessary arithmetic can be done in `Int` range.\n```\n\n### Kata Examples:\n\n```python\n    is_polydivisible(\"1232\", 10)   # => True\n    is_polydivisible(\"123220\", 10) # => False\n    is_polydivisible(\"123220\", 6)  # => True\n    get_polydivisible(22, 10)      # => \"32\"\n    get_polydivisible(22, 16)      # => \"1A\"\n    get_polydivisible(42, 16)      # => \"42\"\n```\n\n#### A Note on Bases\n\nThe maximum base used is base `62`, and uses characters in the following order `[0-9][A-Z][a-z]` to denote its digits, base `n` will use the first `n` characters of this sequence.\n```if-not:haskell\nA constant CHARS has been declared with this sequence for you.\n```", "difficulty": "interview", "id": 1627, "sample_io": [{"input": "123\n10", "output": [true]}, {"input": "1234\n10", "output": [false]}], "test_list": [{"input": "123\n10", "output": [true]}, {"input": "1234\n10", "output": [false]}, {"input": "12345\n10", "output": [false]}, {"input": "12365\n10", "output": [true]}, {"input": "123220\n10", "output": [false]}, {"input": "50041\n6", "output": [true]}, {"input": "140410\n6", "output": [true]}, {"input": "203230\n6", "output": [true]}, {"input": "30043052\n6", "output": [true]}], "starter_code": "\ndef is_polydivisible(s, b):\n\t", "source_codes": ["\ndef is_polydivisible(n, b):\n    n_str = str(n)\n    for i in range(1, len(n_str) + 1):\n        if int(n_str[:i], b) % i != 0:\n            return False\n    return True\n\ndef get_polydivisible(n, b):\n    count = 0\n    num = 0\n    while count < n:\n        if is_polydivisible(num, b):\n            count += 1\n        num += 1\n    return num - 1\n\n\n"], "responses": ["## Algorithms:\nThe core concept in this problem is to check if a given number is polydivisible in a given base, and to find the nth polydivisible number in a given base.\n\n## Tutorial:\nTo check if a number is polydivisible in a given base, we can iterate through the digits of the number and check if the number formed by the first k digits is divisible by k for k from 1 to the length of the number.

{"name": "1622", "description": "# Ten-Pin Bowling\n\nIn the game of ten-pin bowling, a player rolls a bowling ball down a lane to knock over pins. There are ten pins set at the end of the bowling lane. Each player has 10 frames to roll a bowling ball down a lane and knock over as many pins as possible. The first nine frames are ended after two rolls or when the player knocks down all the pins. The last frame a player will receive an extra roll every time they knock down all ten pins; up to a maximum of three total rolls. \n\n## The Challenge\n\nIn this challenge you will be given a string representing a player's ten frames. It will look something like this: `'X X 9/ 80 X X 90 8/ 7/ 44'` (in Java: `\"X X 9/ 80 X X 90 8/ 7/ 44\"`), where each frame is space-delimited, `'X'` represents strikes, and `'/'` represents spares. Your goal is take in this string of frames into a function called `bowlingScore` and return the players total score.\n\n## Scoring\n\nThe scoring for ten-pin bowling can be difficult to understand, and if you're like most people, easily forgotten if you don't play often. Here is a quick breakdown:\n\n### Frames\n\nIn Ten-Pin Bowling there are ten frames per game. Frames are the players turn to bowl, which can be multiple rolls. The first 9 frames you get 2 rolls maximum to try to get all 10 pins down. **On the 10th or last frame a player will receive an extra roll each time they get all ten pins down to a maximum of three total rolls. Also on the last frame bonuses are not awarded for strikes and spares moving forward.**\n\nIn this challenge, three frames might be represented like this: `54 72 44`. In this case, the player has had three frames. On their first frame they scored 9 points (5 + 4), on their second frame they scored 9 points (7 + 2) and on their third frame they scored 8 points (4 + 4). This is a very simple example of bowling scoring. It gets more complicated when we introduce strikes and spares.\n\n### Strikes \nRepresented in this challenge as `'X'`\n\nA strike is scored when a player knocks all ten pins down in one roll. In the first 9 frames this will conclude the players turn and it will be scored as 10 points plus the points received from the next two rolls. So if a player were to have two frames `X 54`, the total score of those two frames would be 28. The first frame would be worth 19 (10 + 5 + 4) and the second frame would be worth 9 (5 + 4).\n\nA perfect game in bowling is 12 strikes in a row and would be represented like this `'X X X X X X X X X XXX'` (in Java: `\"X X X X X X X X X XXX\"`). This adds up to a total score of 300.\n\n### Spares\nRepresented in this challenge as `'/'`\n\nA spare is scored when a player knocks down all ten pins in two rolls. In the first 9 frames this will be scored as 10 points plus the next roll. So if a player were to have two frames `9/ 54`, the total score of the two frames would be 24. The first frame would be worth 15 (10 + 5) and the second frame would be worth 9 (5 + 4).\n\nFor a more detailed explanation see Wikipedia: \n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten-pin_bowling#Scoring", "difficulty": "interview", "id": 1622, "sample_io": [{"input": "11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11", "output": [20]}, {"input": "X X X X X X X X X XXX", "output": [300]}], "test_list": [{"input": "11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11", "output": [20]}, {"input": "X X X X X X X X X XXX", "output": [300]}, {"input": "00 5/ 4/ 53 33 22 4/ 5/ 45 XXX", "output": [115]}, {"input": "5/ 4/ 3/ 2/ 1/ 0/ X 9/ 4/ 8/8", "output": [150]}, {"input": "5/ 4/ 3/ 2/ 1/ 0/ X 9/ 4/ 7/2", "output": [143]}, {"input": "X X 9/ 80 X X 90 8/ 7/ 44", "output": [171]}, {"input": "6/ 5/ 6/ 2/ 3/ 0/ 1/ 8/ 3/ 6/5", "output": [139]}, {"input": "00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 0/X", "output": [20]}, {"input": "00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 X 0/X", "output": [40]}], "starter_code": "\ndef bowling_score(frames):\n\t", "source_codes": ["\ndef bowlingScore(frames):\n    score = 0\n    frame = 0\n    for i in range(len(frames)):\n        if frames[i] == 'X':\n            score += 10\n            score += (10 if frames[i+2] == '/' else (10 if frames[i+1] == 'X' else int(frames[i+1]) + int(frames[i+2])))\n            frame += 1\n        elif frames[i] == '/':\n            score += 10 - int(frames[i-1])\n            score += (10 if frames[i+1] == 'X' else int(frames[i+1]))\n            frame += 1\n        else:\n            score += int(frames[i])\n            frame += 0.5\n        if frame == 10:\n            break\n    return score\n\nframes = input().split()\nprint(bowlingScore(frames))\n\n\n"], "responses": ["## Algorithms:\nTo solve the problem, we can use the following algorithms:\n1.

{"name": "1622", "description": "# Ten-Pin Bowling\n\nIn the game of ten-pin bowling, a player rolls a bowling ball down a lane to knock over pins. There are ten pins set at the end of the bowling lane. Each player has 10 frames to roll a bowling ball down a lane and knock over as many pins as possible. The first nine frames are ended after two rolls or when the player knocks down all the pins. The last frame a player will receive an extra roll every time they knock down all ten pins; up to a maximum of three total rolls. \n\n## The Challenge\n\nIn this challenge you will be given a string representing a player's ten frames. It will look something like this: `'X X 9/ 80 X X 90 8/ 7/ 44'` (in Java: `\"X X 9/ 80 X X 90 8/ 7/ 44\"`), where each frame is space-delimited, `'X'` represents strikes, and `'/'` represents spares. Your goal is take in this string of frames into a function called `bowlingScore` and return the players total score.\n\n## Scoring\n\nThe scoring for ten-pin bowling can be difficult to understand, and if you're like most people, easily forgotten if you don't play often. Here is a quick breakdown:\n\n### Frames\n\nIn Ten-Pin Bowling there are ten frames per game. Frames are the players turn to bowl, which can be multiple rolls. The first 9 frames you get 2 rolls maximum to try to get all 10 pins down. **On the 10th or last frame a player will receive an extra roll each time they get all ten pins down to a maximum of three total rolls. Also on the last frame bonuses are not awarded for strikes and spares moving forward.**\n\nIn this challenge, three frames might be represented like this: `54 72 44`. In this case, the player has had three frames. On their first frame they scored 9 points (5 + 4), on their second frame they scored 9 points (7 + 2) and on their third frame they scored 8 points (4 + 4). This is a very simple example of bowling scoring. It gets more complicated when we introduce strikes and spares.\n\n### Strikes \nRepresented in this challenge as `'X'`\n\nA strike is scored when a player knocks all ten pins down in one roll. In the first 9 frames this will conclude the players turn and it will be scored as 10 points plus the points received from the next two rolls. So if a player were to have two frames `X 54`, the total score of those two frames would be 28. The first frame would be worth 19 (10 + 5 + 4) and the second frame would be worth 9 (5 + 4).\n\nA perfect game in bowling is 12 strikes in a row and would be represented like this `'X X X X X X X X X XXX'` (in Java: `\"X X X X X X X X X XXX\"`). This adds up to a total score of 300.\n\n### Spares\nRepresented in this challenge as `'/'`\n\nA spare is scored when a player knocks down all ten pins in two rolls. In the first 9 frames this will be scored as 10 points plus the next roll. So if a player were to have two frames `9/ 54`, the total score of the two frames would be 24. The first frame would be worth 15 (10 + 5) and the second frame would be worth 9 (5 + 4).\n\nFor a more detailed explanation see Wikipedia: \n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten-pin_bowling#Scoring", "difficulty": "interview", "id": 1622, "sample_io": [{"input": "11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11", "output": [20]}, {"input": "X X X X X X X X X XXX", "output": [300]}], "test_list": [{"input": "11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11", "output": [20]}, {"input": "X X X X X X X X X XXX", "output": [300]}, {"input": "00 5/ 4/ 53 33 22 4/ 5/ 45 XXX", "output": [115]}, {"input": "5/ 4/ 3/ 2/ 1/ 0/ X 9/ 4/ 8/8", "output": [150]}, {"input": "5/ 4/ 3/ 2/ 1/ 0/ X 9/ 4/ 7/2", "output": [143]}, {"input": "X X 9/ 80 X X 90 8/ 7/ 44", "output": [171]}, {"input": "6/ 5/ 6/ 2/ 3/ 0/ 1/ 8/ 3/ 6/5", "output": [139]}, {"input": "00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 0/X", "output": [20]}, {"input": "00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 X 0/X", "output": [40]}], "starter_code": "\ndef bowling_score(frames):\n\t", "source_codes": ["\ndef bowlingScore(frames):\n    score = 0\n    frame = 1\n    i = 0\n    while frame <= 10:\n        if frames[i] == 'X':\n            score += 10\n            score += (10 + (10 if frames[i+2] == 'X' else int(frames[i+2]) if frames[i+2] != '/' else 10 - int(frames[i+1])))\n            i += 1\n        elif frames[i+1] == '/':\n            score += 10\n            score += (10 if frames[i+2] == 'X' else int(frames[i+2]) if frames[i+2] != '/' else 10 - int(frames[i]))\n            i += 3\n        else:\n            score += int(frames[i]) + int(frames[i+1])\n            i += 2\n        frame += 1\n    return score\n\n# take input from standard input\nframes = input().split()\nprint(bowlingScore(frames))\n\n\n"], "responses": ["## Algorithms:\nThe core concepts to solve this problem involve parsing the input string to identify strikes, spares, and regular rolls, and then calculating the total score based on the scoring rules of ten-pin bowling.\n\n## Tutorial:\nTo solve the problem of calculating the total score in ten-pin bowling, we need to follow these steps:\n1.

We can create an array dp[] where dp[i] represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at index i. We can initialize all values of dp[] as 1, as the minimum length of increasing subsequence at any index is 1. Then, for each index i, we can iterate over all previous indices j (0 to i-1) and if arr[i] > arr[j], we can update dp[i] as max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1).

This involves analyzing the possible moves and their outcomes to make the best decision. In the case of the given problem, both players need to make optimal moves to ensure their victory. This can be achieved by analyzing the possible moves and their outcomes for each turn.\n\nThe game can be represented as a state where the number of stones in each pile is the state of the game.

Each turn, a player takes either the first or last stone from the row, and the player with the most stones at the end wins. Determine the winner of the game.\n   - Solution: The optimal strategy for the Stone game involves using dynamic programming to analyze the possible moves and their outcomes. The players need to make optimal moves to ensure their victory.\n   - Python3 code:\n   ```python\n   def stoneGame(piles):\n       n = len(piles)\n       dp = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]\n       for i in range(n):\n           dp[i][i] = piles[i]\n       for length in range(2, n + 1):\n           for i in range(n - length + 1):\n               j = i + length - 1\n               dp[i][j] = max(piles[i] - dp[i + 1][j], piles[j] - dp[i][j - 1])\n       return \"Alex\" if dp[0][n - 1] > 0 else \"Lee\"\n\n   # Example usage\n   piles = [5, 3, 4, 5]\n   print(stoneGame(piles))  # Output: Alex\n   ```\n\n3.

We need to identify the boundary blocks in each tower and then destroy them in each operation until all towers are destroyed.\n\n## Tutorial:\nThe algorithm used in this problem is a simple simulation. We iterate through each tower and count the number of boundary blocks. Then we destroy the boundary blocks and repeat the process until all towers are destroyed.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. Problem: Destroy the Blocks\n   - You are given a 2D grid representing blocks. Each block has four neighbors. In each operation, you need to destroy all the boundary blocks. Find the minimum number of operations needed to destroy all the blocks.\n   - Solution: We can iterate through the grid and count the number of boundary blocks. Then we destroy them and repeat the process until all blocks are destroyed.\n   - Python3 code:\n   ```python\n   def minOperationsToDestroyBlocks(grid):\n       # implementation of the algorithm\n   ```\n\n2. Problem: Building Demolition\n   - You are given a row of buildings with different heights. In each operation, you can destroy all the boundary buildings. Find the minimum number of operations needed to destroy all the buildings.\n   - Solution: We can iterate through the row of buildings and count the number of boundary buildings. Then we destroy them and repeat the process until all buildings are destroyed.\n   - Python3 code:\n   ```python\n   def minOperationsToDestroyBuildings(heights):\n       # implementation of the algorithm\n   ```\n\n3. Problem: Wall Destruction\n   - You are given a wall made up of different sized blocks. In each operation, you can destroy all the boundary blocks. Find the minimum number of operations needed to destroy the entire wall.\n   - Solution: We can iterate through the wall and count the number of boundary blocks. Then we destroy them and repeat the process until the entire wall is destroyed.\n   - Python3 code:\n   ```python\n   def minOperationsToDestroyWall(blocks):\n       # implementation of the algorithm\n   ```\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n```python\ndef minOperationsToDestroyTowers(n, heights):\n    operations = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        if i == 0:\n            operations += heights[i]\n        else:\n            operations += abs(heights[i] - heights[i-1])\n        operations += 2  # destroying the boundary blocks\n    return operations\n\n# Read input\nn = int(input())\nheights = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n# Call the function and print the output\nprint(minOperationsToDestroyTowers(n, heights))\n```"], "prompt_tokens": [587], "completion_tokens": [550], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": false, "language": "Python3", "task_id": 2010}
{"name": "2064", "description": "3R2 as DJ Mashiro - Happiness Breeze Ice - DJ Mashiro is dead or alive\n\nNEKO#\u03a6\u03c9\u03a6 has just got a new maze game on her PC!\n\nThe game's main puzzle is a maze, in the forms of a $2 \\times n$ rectangle grid. NEKO's task is to lead a Nekomimi girl from cell $(1, 1)$ to the gate at $(2, n)$ and escape the maze. The girl can only move between cells sharing a common side.\n\nHowever, at some moments during the game, some cells may change their state: either from normal ground to lava (which forbids movement into that cell), or vice versa (which makes that cell passable again). Initially all cells are of the ground type.\n\nAfter hours of streaming, NEKO finally figured out there are only $q$ such moments: the $i$-th moment toggles the state of cell $(r_i, c_i)$ (either from ground to lava or vice versa).\n\nKnowing this, NEKO wonders, after each of the $q$ moments, whether it is still possible to move from cell $(1, 1)$ to cell $(2, n)$ without going through any lava cells.\n\nAlthough NEKO is a great streamer and gamer, she still can't get through quizzes and problems requiring large amount of Brain Power. Can you help her?\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains integers $n$, $q$ ($2 \\le n \\le 10^5$, $1 \\le q \\le 10^5$).\n\nThe $i$-th of $q$ following lines contains two integers $r_i$, $c_i$ ($1 \\le r_i \\le 2$, $1 \\le c_i \\le n$), denoting the coordinates of the cell to be flipped at the $i$-th moment.\n\nIt is guaranteed that cells $(1, 1)$ and $(2, n)$ never appear in the query list.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each moment, if it is possible to travel from cell $(1, 1)$ to cell $(2, n)$, print \"Yes\", otherwise print \"No\". There should be exactly $q$ answers, one after every update.\n\nYou can print the words in any case (either lowercase, uppercase or mixed).\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n5 5\n2 3\n1 4\n2 4\n2 3\n1 4\n\nOutput\nYes\nNo\nNo\nNo\nYes\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nWe'll crack down the example test here:  After the first query, the girl still able to reach the goal. One of the shortest path ways should be: $(1,1) \\to (1,2) \\to (1,3) \\to (1,4) \\to (1,5) \\to (2,5)$.  After the second query, it's impossible to move to the goal, since the farthest cell she could reach is $(1, 3)$.  After the fourth query, the $(2, 3)$ is not blocked, but now all the $4$-th column is blocked, so she still can't reach the goal.  After the fifth query, the column barrier has been lifted, thus she can go to the final goal again.", "difficulty": "competition", "id": 2064, "sample_io": [{"input": "5 5\n2 3\n1 4\n2 4\n2 3\n1 4\n",

{"name": "2183", "description": "We start with a string $s$ consisting only of the digits $1$, $2$, or $3$. The length of $s$ is denoted by $|s|$. For each $i$ from $1$ to $|s|$, the $i$-th character of $s$ is denoted by $s_i$. \n\nThere is one cursor. The cursor's location $\\ell$ is denoted by an integer in $\\{0, \\ldots, |s|\\}$, with the following meaning:   If $\\ell = 0$, then the cursor is located before the first character of $s$.  If $\\ell = |s|$, then the cursor is located right after the last character of $s$.  If $0 < \\ell < |s|$, then the cursor is located between $s_\\ell$ and $s_{\\ell+1}$. \n\nWe denote by $s_\\text{left}$ the string to the left of the cursor and $s_\\text{right}$ the string to the right of the cursor. \n\nWe also have a string $c$, which we call our clipboard, which starts out as empty. There are three types of actions:  The Move action. Move the cursor one step to the right. This increments $\\ell$ once.  The Cut action. Set $c \\leftarrow s_\\text{right}$, then set $s \\leftarrow s_\\text{left}$.  The Paste action. Append the value of $c$ to the end of the string $s$. Note that this doesn't modify $c$. \n\nThe cursor initially starts at $\\ell = 0$. Then, we perform the following procedure:  Perform the Move action once.  Perform the Cut action once.  Perform the Paste action $s_\\ell$ times.  If $\\ell = x$, stop. Otherwise, return to step 1. \n\nYou're given the initial string $s$ and the integer $x$. What is the length of $s$ when the procedure stops? Since this value may be very large, only find it modulo $10^9 + 7$. \n\nIt is guaranteed that $\\ell \\le |s|$ at any time.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of input contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 1000$) denoting the number of test cases.

It is guaranteed, that $s$ consists of the characters \"1\", \"2\", \"3\".\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $x$ in a single file is at most $10^6$.

Step 2, Cut once: we get $s = $ 23 and $c = $ 131.  Step 3, Paste $s_\\ell = $ 3 times: we get $s = $ 23131131131.  Step 4: $\\ell = 2 \\not= x = 5$, so we return to step 1. \n\n  Step 1, Move once: we get $\\ell = 3$.  Step 2, Cut once: we get $s = $ 231 and $c = $ 31131131.  Step 3, Paste $s_\\ell = $ 1 time: we get $s = $ 23131131131.  Step 4: $\\ell = 3 \\not= x = 5$, so we return to step 1. \n\n  Step 1, Move once: we get $\\ell = 4$.  Step 2, Cut once: we get $s = $ 2313 and $c = $ 1131131.  Step 3, Paste $s_\\ell = $ 3 times: we get $s = $ 2313113113111311311131131.

There are many ways to represent such a tree. One way is to create an array with n integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_{n}, where p_{i} denotes a parent of vertex i (here, for convenience a root is considered its own parent). [Image] For this rooted tree the array p is [2, 3, 3, 2]. \n\nGiven a sequence p_1, p_2, ..., p_{n}, one is able to restore a tree:  There must be exactly one index r that p_{r} = r. A vertex r is a root of the tree.  For all other n - 1 vertices i, there is an edge between vertex i and vertex p_{i}. \n\nA sequence p_1, p_2, ..., p_{n} is called valid if the described procedure generates some (any) rooted tree. For example, for n = 3 sequences (1,2,2), (2,3,1) and (2,1,3) are not valid.\n\nYou are given a sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}, not necessarily valid. Your task is to change the minimum number of elements, in order to get a valid sequence. Print the minimum number of changes and an example of a valid sequence after that number of changes. If there are many valid sequences achievable in the minimum number of changes, print any of them.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains an integer n (2 \u2264 n \u2264 200 000)\u00a0\u2014 the number of vertices in the tree.\n\nThe second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 \u2264 a_{i} \u2264 n).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIn the first line print the minimum number of elements to change, in order to get a valid sequence.\n\nIn the second line, print any valid sequence possible to get from (a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}) in the minimum number of changes.

For each person you know the floor where he currently is and the floor he wants to reach. Also, you know the order in which people came to the elevator.\n\nAccording to the company's rules, if an employee comes to the elevator earlier than another one, he has to enter the elevator earlier too (even if these employees stay on different floors). Note that the employees are allowed to leave the elevator in arbitrary order.\n\nThe elevator has two commands:   Go up or down one floor. The movement takes 1 second.  Open the doors on the current floor. During this operation all the employees who have reached their destination get out of the elevator. Then all the employees on the floor get in the elevator in the order they are queued up while it doesn't contradict the company's rules and there is enough space in the elevator.

Then, for each movement or opening of the doors, we can calculate the time taken and update the state of the elevator and the people inside it.\n\nWe can use a queue to keep track of the order in which people enter and exit the elevator. When the elevator opens its doors, we can check the queue and let people in or out based on the company's rules.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. Problem: Elevator Trouble (Codeforces)\n   - In this problem, you are given the maximum weight the elevator can carry, the number of floors, the initial floor, the target floor, and the time taken to move between floors. You need to determine if it's possible to reach the target floor given the weight constraints and the time taken to move between floors.\n   - Solution: We can use a BFS approach to simulate the movement of the elevator and check if it's possible to reach the target floor within the given constraints.\n   - Python3 code:\n   ```python\n   # Code for Elevator Trouble problem\n   # ...\n   ```\n\n2. Problem: Lift Queries (CodeChef)\n   - In this problem, you are given the number of floors, the initial floor, and the target floors of people waiting for the elevator. You need to determine the total time taken to deliver all the people to their target floors.\n   - Solution: We can simulate the movement of the elevator and the people inside it, keeping track of the time taken for each movement and the time taken for people to get in and out of the elevator.\n   - Python3 code:\n   ```python\n   # Code for Lift Queries problem\n   # ...\n   ```\n\n3. Problem: Elevator (AtCoder)\n   - In this problem, you are given the number of floors, the initial floor, the target floor, and the time taken to move between floors. You need to determine the minimum time taken to reach the target floor.\n   - Solution: We can simulate the movement of the elevator and calculate the time taken to reach the target floor based on the given constraints.\n   - Python3 code:\n   ```python\n   # Code for Elevator problem\n   # ...\n   ```\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n```python\ndef min_time_to_deliver_employees(n, employees):\n    current_floor = 1\n    total_time = 0\n    queue = []\n\n    for i in range(n):\n        a, b = employees[i]\n        total_time += abs(a - current_floor)  # time taken to move to the employee's floor\n        total_time += 1  # time taken to open the doors\n        current_floor = a\n\n        queue.append((b, i))  # add the employee's target floor and index to the queue\n\n        while queue:\n            next_floor, idx = queue[0]\n            if len(queue) <= 4 and next_floor == current_floor:  # check if there's enough space in the elevator and if the employee's target floor is the current floor\n                queue.pop(0)  # remove the employee from the queue\n                total_time += 1  # time taken for the employee to get out of the elevator\n            else:\n                break\n\n        total_time += len(queue)  # time taken for the remaining employees to get in the elevator\n        current_floor = next_floor  # update the current floor\n\n    return total_time\n\n# Take input\nn = int(input())\nemployees = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]\n\n# Call the function and print the output\nprint(min_time_to_deliver_employees(n, employees))\n```"], "prompt_tokens": [762], "completion_tokens": [841], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": false, "language": "Python3", "task_id": 2037}

This can be solved using Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from the capital to every other city, and then comparing the lengths of the train routes to the shortest path lengths.\n\n## Tutorial:\nDijkstra's algorithm is a popular algorithm for finding the shortest path from a single source vertex to all other vertices in a weighted graph. It works by maintaining a set of vertices whose shortest distance from the source is known. It then repeatedly selects the vertex with the minimum distance, updates the distances of its neighbors, and adds it to the set of known vertices. This process continues until all vertices have been added to the set.\n\nTo solve the given problem, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from the capital to every other city. Then, for each train route, we compare the length of the route to the shortest path length from the capital to the destination city. If the train route is longer, it means it can be closed without affecting the shortest path length.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1.

Problem: Train Routes\n   - Given a graph representing train routes and their lengths, find the maximum number of train routes that can be closed without changing the length of the shortest path from every city to the capital.\n   - Solution: Use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from the capital to every other city, then compare the train route lengths to the shortest path lengths to determine the maximum number of routes that can be closed.\n   - Python3 code:\n   ```python\n   # Use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from the capital to every other city\n   distances = dijkstra(graph, capital)\n   # Compare train route lengths to the shortest path lengths and count the maximum number of routes that can be closed\n   ```\n\n3.

{"name": "2047", "description": "Allen dreams of one day owning a enormous fleet of electric cars, the car of the future! He knows that this will give him a big status boost. As Allen is planning out all of the different types of cars he will own and how he will arrange them, he realizes that he has a problem. \n\nAllen's future parking lot can be represented as a rectangle with $4$ rows and $n$ ($n \\le 50$) columns of rectangular spaces, each of which can contain at most one car at any time. He imagines having $k$ ($k \\le 2n$) cars in the grid, and all the cars are initially in the second and third rows. Each of the cars also has a different designated parking space in the first or fourth row. Allen has to put the cars into corresponding parking places.\n\n [Image] Illustration to the first example. \n\nHowever, since Allen would never entrust his cars to anyone else, only one car can be moved at a time. He can drive a car from a space in any of the four cardinal directions to a neighboring empty space. Furthermore, Allen can only move one of his cars into a space on the first or fourth rows if it is the car's designated parking space. \n\nAllen knows he will be a very busy man, and will only have time to move cars at most $20000$ times before he realizes that moving cars is not worth his time. Help Allen determine if he should bother parking his cars or leave it to someone less important.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains two space-separated integers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \\le n \\le 50$, $1 \\le k \\le 2n$), representing the number of columns and the number of cars, respectively.\n\nThe next four lines will contain $n$ integers each between $0$ and $k$ inclusive, representing the initial state of the parking lot. The rows are numbered $1$ to $4$ from top to bottom and the columns are numbered $1$ to $n$ from left to right.\n\nIn the first and last line, an integer $1 \\le x \\le k$ represents a parking spot assigned to car $x$ (you can only move this car to this place), while the integer $0$ represents a empty space (you can't move any car to this place).\n\nIn the second and third line, an integer $1 \\le x \\le k$ represents initial position of car $x$, while the integer $0$ represents an empty space (you can move any car to this place).\n\nEach $x$ between $1$ and $k$ appears exactly once in the second and third line, and exactly once in the first and fourth line.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIf there is a sequence of moves that brings all of the cars to their parking spaces, with at most $20000$ car moves, then print $m$, the number of moves, on the first line. On the following $m$ lines, print the moves (one move per line) in the format $i$ $r$ $c$, which corresponds to Allen moving car $i$ to the neighboring space at row $r$ and column $c$.\n\nIf it is not possible for Allen to move all the cars to the correct spaces with at most $20000$ car moves, print a single line with the integer $-1$.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n4 5\n1 2 0 4\n1 2 0 4\n5 0 0 3\n0 5 0 3\n\nOutput\n6\n1 1 1\n2 1 2\n4 1 4\n3 4 4\n5 3 2\n5 4 2\n\nInput\n1 2\n1\n2\n1\n2\n\nOutput\n-1\n\nInput\n1 2\n1\n1\n2\n2\n\nOutput\n2\n1 1 1\n2 4 1\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample test case, all cars are in front of their spots except car $5$, which is in front of the parking spot adjacent. The example shows the shortest possible sequence of moves, but any sequence of length at most $20000$ will be accepted.\n\nIn the second sample test case, there is only one column, and the cars are in the wrong order, so no cars can move and the task is impossible.", "difficulty": "competition", "id": 2047, "sample_io": [{"input": "4 5\n1 2 0 4\n1 2 0 4\n5 0 0 3\n0 5 0 3\n", "output": ["6\n1 1 1\n2

to find the shortest path for each car to reach its designated parking space.\n\n## Tutorial:\nBreadth First Search (BFS) is an algorithm used for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It starts at the tree root (or some arbitrary node of a graph), and explores all of the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level.\n\nIn this problem, we can use BFS to find the shortest path for each car to reach its designated parking space. We can represent the parking lot as a 2D grid, where each cell represents a space in the parking lot. We start by adding the initial positions of the cars to a queue, and then perform BFS to find the shortest path for each car to reach its designated parking space. We keep track of the number of moves and the path for each car, and if the total number of moves is less than or equal to 20000, we output the moves.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. Problem: Minimum Moves to Reach Target with Rotations\n   - Description: Given a grid representing a parking lot, where each cell can be empty or blocked, and a car can be horizontal or vertical, find the minimum number of moves to reach the target position with rotations allowed.\n   - Solution: We can use BFS to find the shortest path for the car to reach the target position, considering both horizontal and vertical positions of the car.\n   - Python3 code:\n   ```python\n   # Write the Python3 code for the problem here\n   ```\n\n2. Problem: Car Fleet\n   - Description: Given the position and speed of cars, and the target position, determine the number of car fleets that will reach the target position at the same time.\n   - Solution: We can use BFS to simulate the movement of cars and determine the time it takes for each car to reach the target position, then group the cars into fleets based on their arrival time.\n   - Python3 code:\n   ```python\n   # Write the Python3 code for the problem here\n   ```\n\n3. Problem: Sliding Puzzle\n   - Description: Given a 3x3 board with 8 tiles and an empty space, find the minimum number of moves to reach the target state from the initial state.\n   - Solution: We can use BFS to find the shortest path from the initial state to the target state, considering the possible moves of the empty space.\n   - Python3 code:\n   ```python\n   # Write the Python3 code for the problem here\n   ```\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef move_cars(n, k, parking_lot):\n    moves = []\n    directions = [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]\n\n    def bfs(start, end):\n        queue = deque([(start, [])])\n        visited = set()\n        while queue:\n            (r, c), path = queue.popleft()\n            if (r, c) == end:\n                return path\n            for dr, dc in directions:\n                nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\n                if 0 <= nr < 4 and 0 <= nc < n and parking_lot[nr][nc] == 0 and (nr, nc) not in visited:\n                    queue.append(((nr, nc), path + [(nr, nc)]))\n                    visited.add((nr, nc))\n        return []\n\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(2):\n            if parking_lot[j + 2][i] != 0:\n                path = bfs((j + 2, i), (j, i))\n                if not path:\n                    return -1\n                moves.extend([(parking_lot[j + 2][i], r + 1, c + 1) for r, c in path])\n                parking_lot[j][i] = parking_lot[j + 2][i]\n                parking_lot[j + 2][i] = 0\n\n    return len(moves), moves\n\n# Read input\nn, k = map(int, input().split())\nparking_lot = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(4)]\n\n# Call the function and print the output\nresult = move_cars(n, k, parking_lot)\nif result == -1:\n    print(-1)\nelse:\n    print(result[0])\n    for move in result[1]:\n        print(*move)\n```"], "prompt_tokens": [1241], "completion_tokens": [955], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": false, "language": "Python3", "task_id": 2047}

{"name": "2159", "description": "Polycarp is making a quest for his friends. He has already made n tasks, for each task the boy evaluated how interesting it is as an integer q_{i}, and the time t_{i} in minutes needed to complete the task. \n\nAn interesting feature of his quest is: each participant should get the task that is best suited for him, depending on his preferences. The task is chosen based on an interactive quiz that consists of some questions. The player should answer these questions with \"yes\" or \"no\". Depending on the answer to the question, the participant either moves to another question or goes to one of the tasks that are in the quest. In other words, the quest is a binary tree, its nodes contain questions and its leaves contain tasks. \n\nWe know that answering any of the questions that are asked before getting a task takes exactly one minute from the quest player. Polycarp knows that his friends are busy people and they can't participate in the quest for more than T minutes. Polycarp wants to choose some of the n tasks he made, invent the corresponding set of questions for them and use them to form an interactive quiz as a binary tree so that no matter how the player answers quiz questions, he spends at most T minutes on completing the whole quest (that is, answering all the questions and completing the task). Specifically, the quest can contain zero questions and go straight to the task. Each task can only be used once (i.e., the people who give different answers to questions should get different tasks).\n\nPolycarp wants the total \"interest\" value of the tasks involved in the quest to be as large as possible. Help him determine the maximum possible total interest value of the task considering that the quest should be completed in T minutes at any variant of answering questions.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and T (1 \u2264 n \u2264 1000, 1 \u2264 T \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of tasks made by Polycarp and the maximum time a quest player should fit into.\n\nNext n lines contain two integers t_{i}, q_{i} (1 \u2264 t_{i} \u2264 T, 1 \u2264 q_{i} \u2264 1000) each \u2014 the time in minutes needed to complete the i-th task and its interest value.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint a single integer \u2014 the maximum possible total interest value of all the tasks in the quest.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n5 5\n1 1\n1 1\n2 2\n3 3\n4 4\n\nOutput\n11\n\nInput\n5 5\n4 1\n4 2\n4 3\n4 4\n4 5\n\nOutput\n9\n\nInput\n2 2\n1 1\n2 10\n\nOutput\n10\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample test all the five tasks can be complemented with four questions and joined into one quest.\n\nIn the second sample test it is impossible to use all the five tasks, but you can take two of them, the most interesting ones.\n\nIn the third sample test the optimal strategy is to include only the second task into the quest.\n\nHere is the picture that illustrates the answers to the sample tests.

It involves storing the results of subproblems so that they can be reused later. In this problem, we can use dynamic programming to find the maximum total interest value of the tasks in the quest within the given time limit. By considering each task and the time required to complete it, we can build a 2D array to store the maximum interest value that can be achieved within a given time limit.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. Problem: Knapsack Problem\n   - In this problem, you are given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, and a knapsack with a maximum capacity. The goal is to find the most valuable combination of items that can be fit into the knapsack without exceeding its capacity.\n   - Solution: This problem can be solved using dynamic programming.

Problem: Coin Change Problem\n   - Given a set of coins with different denominations and a target amount, the goal is to find the minimum number of coins needed to make up that amount.\n   - Solution: This problem can be solved using dynamic programming.

Problem: N-Queens Problem\n   - Given an integer n, place n queens on an n\u00d7n chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other.\n   - Solution: This problem can be solved using the backtracking approach. We recursively try all possible positions for the queens and backtrack if two queens threaten each other.\n   - Python3 code:\n   ```python\n   def isSafe(board, row, col, n):\n       for i in range(col):\n           if board[row][i] == 1:\n               return False\n       for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, -1, -1)):\n           if board[i][j] == 1:\n               return False\n       for i, j in zip(range(row, n, 1), range(col, -1, -1)):\n           if board[i][j] == 1:\n               return False\n       return True\n   ```\n\n3. Problem: Knapsack Problem\n   - Given weights and values of n items, put these items in a knapsack of capacity W to get the maximum total value in the knapsack.\n   - Solution: This problem can be solved using the dynamic programming approach, where we consider all possible combinations of items and their weights to find the maximum total value.\n   - Python3 code:\n   ```python\n   def knapSack(W, wt, val, n):\n       if n == 0 or W == 0:\n           return 0\n       if wt[n-1] > W:\n           return knapSack(W, wt, val, n-1)\n       else:\n           return max(val[n-1] + knapSack(W-wt[n-1], wt, val, n-1), knapSack(W, wt, val, n-1))\n   ```\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n```python\ndef findSequenceOfMoves(n, vectors):\n    moves = [1] * n\n    for i in range(n):\n        if (vectors[i][0] + vectors[i][1]) % 2 == 0:\n            moves[i] = 1\n        else:\n            moves[i] = -1\n    return moves\n\n# Read input\nn = int(input())\nvectors = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]\n\n# Call the function and print the output\nprint(*findSequenceOfMoves(n, vectors))\n```"], "prompt_tokens": [817], "completion_tokens": [895], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": false, "language": "Python3", "task_id": 2009}
{"name": "2066", "description": "In the official contest this problem has a different statement, for which jury's solution was working incorrectly, and for this reason it was excluded from the contest. This mistake have been fixed and the current given problem statement and model solution corresponds to what jury wanted it to be during the contest.\n\nVova and Lesha are friends. They often meet at Vova's place and compete against each other in a computer game named The Ancient Papyri: Swordsink. Vova always chooses a warrior as his fighter and Leshac chooses an archer. After that they should choose initial positions for their characters and start the fight. A warrior is good at melee combat, so Vova will try to make the distance between fighters as small as possible. An archer prefers to keep the enemy at a distance, so Lesha will try to make the initial distance as large as possible.\n\nThere are n (n is always even) possible starting positions for characters marked along the Ox axis. The positions are given by their distinct coordinates x_1, x_2, ..., x_{n}, two characters cannot end up at the same position.\n\nVova and Lesha take turns banning available positions, Vova moves first. During each turn one of the guys bans exactly one of the remaining positions. Banned positions cannot be used by both Vova and Lesha. They continue to make moves until there are only two possible positions remaining (thus, the total number of moves will be n - 2). After that Vova's character takes the position with the lesser coordinate and Lesha's character takes the position with the bigger coordinate and the guys start fighting.\n\nVova and Lesha are already tired by the game of choosing positions, as they need to play it before every fight, so they asked you (the developer of the The Ancient Papyri: Swordsink) to write a module that would automatically determine the distance at which the warrior and the archer will start fighting if both Vova and Lesha play optimally.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line on the input contains a single integer n (2 \u2264 n \u2264 200 000, n is even)\u00a0\u2014 the number of positions available initially.

In one second you can nest the first chain into the second one and get 1 \u2192 2 \u2192 3.\n\nIn the second sample test you need to disassemble all the three chains into individual matryoshkas in 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 seconds and then assemble one big chain in 6 seconds.", "difficulty": "competition", "id": 2065, "sample_io": [{"input": "3 2\n2 1 2\n1 3\n", "output": ["1\n"]}, {"input": "7 3\n3 1 3 7\n2 2 5\n2 4 6\n", "output": ["10\n"]}], "test_list": [{"input": "3 2\n2 1 2\n1 3\n", "output": ["1\n"]}, {"input": "7 3\n3 1 3 7\n2 2 5\n2 4 6\n", "output": ["10\n"]}, {"input": "1 1\n1 1\n", "output": ["0\n"]}, {"input": "3 2\n1 2\n2 1 3\n", "output": ["3\n"]}, {"input": "5 3\n1 4\n3 1 2 3\n1 5\n", "output": ["2\n"]}, {"input": "8 5\n2 1 2\n2 3 4\n1 5\n2 6 7\n1 8\n", "output": ["8\n"]}, {"input": "10 10\n1 5\n1 4\n1 10\n1 3\n1 7\n1 1\n1 8\n1 6\n1 9\n1 2\n", "output": ["9\n"]}, {"input": "20 6\n3 8 9 13\n3 4 14 20\n2 15 17\n3 2 5 11\n5 7 10 12 18 19\n4 1 3 6 16\n", "output": ["33\n"]}, {"input": "50 10\n6 17 21 31 42 45 49\n6 11 12 15 22 26 38\n3 9 29 36\n3 10 23 43\n5 14 19 28 46 48\n2 30 39\n6 13 20 24 33 37 47\n8 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\n7 16 18 25 27 34 40 44\n4 32 35 41 50\n", "output": ["75\n"]}, {"input": "13 8\n1 5\n2 8 10\n1 13\n4 1 2 3 11\n1 7\n2 6 12\n1 4\n1 9\n", "output": ["13\n"]}, {"input": "21 13\n1 18\n2 8 13\n1 21\n1 17\n2 7 9\n1 20\n1 19\n1 4\n1 16\n2 5 6\n3 12 14 15\n3 1 2 3\n2 10 11\n", "output": ["24\n"]}, {"input": "50 50\n1 2\n1 5\n1 28\n1 46\n1 42\n1 24\n1 3\n1 37\n1 33\n1 50\n1 23\n1 40\n1 43\n1 26\n1 49\n1 34\n1 8\n1 45\n1 15\n1 1\n1 22\n1 18\n1 27\n1 25\n1 13\n1 39\n1 38\n1 10\n1 44\n1 6\n1 17\n1 47\n1 7\n1 35\n1 20\n1 36\n1 31\n1 21\n1 32\n1 29\n1 4\n1 12\n1 19\n1 16\n1 11\n1 41\n1 9\n1 14\n1 30\n1 48\n", "output": ["49\n"]}, {"input": "100 3\n45 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 19 21 24 27 28 30 34 35 37 39 40 41 42 43 46 47 48 51 52 55 58 59 61 63 64 66 69 71 76 80 85 86 88 89 94 99\n26 10 11 15 18 23 29 31 33 36 38 44 49 54 56 60 62 65 75 78 82 83 84 95 96 97 98\n29 12 13 14 16 17 20 22 25 26 32 45 50 53 57 67 68 70 72 73 74 77 79 81 87 90 91 92 93 100\n", "output": ["180\n"]}, {"input": "100 19\n6 62 72 83 91 94 97\n3 61 84 99\n1 63\n5 46 53 56 69 78\n5 41 43 49 74 89\n5 55 57 79 85 87\n3 47 59 98\n3 64 76 82\n3 48 66 75\n2 60 88\n2 67 77\n4 40 51 73 95\n41 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 44 71 81\n4 58 65 90 93\n1 100\n5 39 45 52 80 86\n2 50 68\n1 92\n4 42 54 70 96\n", "output": ["106\n"]}], "starter_code": "", "source_codes": ["\ndef min_seconds_to_assemble(n, k, chains):\n    stack = []\n    for chain in chains:\n        for matryoshka in chain[1:]:\n            if not stack or matryoshka > stack[-1]:\n                stack.append(matryoshka)\n            else:\n                while stack and matryoshka < stack[-1]:\n                    stack.pop()\n                stack.append(matryoshka)\n    return n - len(stack)\n\n# Taking input\nn, k = map(int, input().split())\nchains = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(k)]\n\n# Calling the function and printing the output\nprint(min_seconds_to_assemble(n, k, chains))\n\n\n"], "responses": ["## Algorithms:\nThe core concept in this problem is to find the minimum number of seconds needed to assemble one large chain from the initial configuration of matryoshka dolls. This can be done by disassembling all the chains into individual matryoshkas and then assembling them into one large chain.\n\n## Tutorial:\nTo solve this problem, we can use the concept of stack data structure. We can iterate through the chains and keep track of the top element of the stack. If the current element is greater than the top element, we push it onto the stack. If the current element is smaller than the top element, we pop elements from the stack until the top element is greater than the current element. The number of seconds needed will be the total number of elements in the chains minus the size of the stack.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. Problem: Nesting Depth\n   - Description: Given a string of digits, we need to insert a minimum number of opening and closing parentheses into it such that the resulting string is balanced and each digit d is inside exactly d pairs of matching parentheses.\n   - Solution: We can iterate through the string and keep track of the current depth. Whenever the current digit is greater than the previous digit, we need to insert opening parentheses. Similarly, whenever the current digit is smaller than the previous digit, we need to insert closing parentheses.\n   - Python3 code:\n   ```python\n   def nesting_depth(s):\n       result = \"\"\n       depth = 0\n       for digit in s:\n           diff = int(digit) - depth\n           if diff > 0:\n               result += \"(\" * diff\n           elif diff < 0:\n               result += \")\" * abs(diff)\n           result += digit\n           depth = int(digit)\n       result += \")\" * depth\n       return result\n\n   s = \"021\"\n   print(nesting_depth(s))  # Output: \"(0(2)1)\"\n   ```\n\n2. Problem: Bracket Sequences\n   - Description: Given a sequence of brackets, we need to find the number of ways to insert brackets into the sequence such that it becomes balanced.\n   - Solution: We can use the concept of stack to iterate through the sequence and keep track of the current balance. If we encounter an opening bracket, we push it onto the stack. If we encounter a closing bracket, we pop the top element from the stack if it matches the current bracket. The number of ways will be 2 raised to the power of half the size of the stack.\n   - Python3 code:\n   ```python\n   def bracket_sequences(s):\n       stack = []\n       for bracket in s:\n           if bracket == \"(\":\n               stack.append(bracket)\n           else:\n               if stack and stack[-1] == \"(\":\n                   stack.pop()\n               else:\n                   stack.append(bracket)\n       ways = 2 ** (len(stack) // 2)\n       return ways\n\n   s = \"(()))(\"\n   print(bracket_sequences(s))  # Output: 4\n   ```\n\n3. Problem: Maximum Nesting Depth of the Parentheses\n   - Description: Given a valid parentheses string s, we need to find the maximum nesting depth of the parentheses.\n   - Solution: We can iterate through the string and keep track of the current depth. Whenever we encounter an opening parenthesis, we increment the depth. The maximum depth will be the answer.\n   - Python3 code:\n   ```python\n   def max_nesting_depth(s):\n       max_depth = 0\n       depth = 0\n       for bracket in s:\n           if bracket == \"(\":\n               depth += 1\n               max_depth = max(max_depth, depth)\n           elif bracket == \")\":\n               depth -= 1\n       return max_depth\n\n   s = \"(1+(2*3)+((8)/4))+1\"\n   print(max_nesting_depth(s))  # Output: 3\n   ```\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n```python\ndef min_seconds_to_assemble(n, k, chains):\n    stack = []\n    for chain in chains:\n        for matryoshka in chain[1:]:\n            if not stack or matryoshka > stack[-1]:\n                stack.append(matryoshka)\n            else:\n                while stack and matryoshka < stack[-1]:\n                    stack.pop()\n                stack.append(matryoshka)\n    return n - len(stack)\n\n# Taking input\nn, k = map(int, input().split())\nchains = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(k)]\n\n# Calling the function and printing the output\nprint(min_seconds_to_assemble(n, k, chains))\n```"], "prompt_tokens": [983], "completion_tokens": [963], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": false, "language": "Python3", "task_id": 2065}
{"name": "2198", "description": "There are some ambiguities when one writes Berland names with the letters of the Latin alphabet.\n\nFor example, the Berland sound u can be written in the Latin alphabet as \"u\", and can be written as \"oo\". For this reason, two words \"ulyana\" and \"oolyana\" denote the same name.\n\nThe second ambiguity is about the Berland sound h: one can use both \"h\" and \"kh\" to write it. For example, the words \"mihail\" and \"mikhail\" denote the same name.\n\nThere are n users registered on the Polycarp's website. Each of them indicated a name represented by the Latin letters. How many distinct names are there among them, if two ambiguities described above are taken into account?\n\nFormally, we assume that two words denote the same name, if using the replacements \"u\"\u00a0[Image]\u00a0\"oo\" and \"h\"\u00a0[Image]\u00a0\"kh\", you can make the words equal. One can make replacements in both directions, in any of the two words an arbitrary number of times. A letter that resulted from the previous replacement can participate in the next replacements.\n\nFor example, the following pairs of words denote the same name:  \"koouper\" and \"kuooper\". Making the replacements described above, you can make both words to be equal: \"koouper\" $\\rightarrow$ \"kuuper\" and \"kuooper\" $\\rightarrow$ \"kuuper\".  \"khun\" and \"kkkhoon\".

Problem: Word Chains\n   - Given a list of words, find the longest chain that can be formed by connecting the words in such a way that the last letter of one word is the same as the first letter of the next word.\n   - Solution: We can create a graph where each word is a node and there is an edge between two nodes if the last letter of the first word is the same as the first letter of the second word.

Problem: Maximum Number of Prizes\n   - Description: You are given an integer n. You want to represent n as a sum of maximum number of distinct positive integers. For this, you need to find the maximum number of distinct positive integers that sum up to n.\n   - Solution: We can solve this problem using the concept of dynamic programming.

We can use an array dp[] to store the maximum number of distinct positive integers that sum up to each number. At each position i, we will iterate through all the numbers to the left of i and check if the current number can form a sum with the numbers to the left.

We can use an array dp[] to store the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at each position. At each position i, we will iterate through all the elements to the left of i and check if the current element is greater than the elements to the left.

It works by making the best choice at each step that leads to the optimal solution. In this problem, we can use the greedy algorithm to split the photos into groups by sorting the contrast values and then forming groups with the minimum difference between the maximum and minimum values.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1.

The robot has two different arms \u2014 the left one and the right one. The robot can consecutively perform the following actions:   Take the leftmost item with the left hand and spend w_{i} \u00b7 l energy units (w_{i} is a weight of the leftmost item, l is some parameter). If the previous action was the same (left-hand), then the robot spends extra Q_{l} energy units;  Take the rightmost item with the right hand and spend w_{j} \u00b7 r energy units (w_{j} is a weight of the rightmost item, r is some parameter). If the previous action was the same (right-hand), then the robot spends extra Q_{r} energy units; \n\nNaturally, Vasya wants to program the robot in a way that the robot spends as little energy as possible.

You can only move right or down, one cell per step. Moving right from a cell $(x, y)$ takes you to the cell $(x, y + 1)$, while moving down takes you to the cell $(x + 1, y)$.\n\nSome cells of the labyrinth contain rocks. When you move to a cell with rock, the rock is pushed to the next cell in the direction you're moving. If the next cell contains a rock, it gets pushed further, and so on.\n\nThe labyrinth is surrounded by impenetrable walls, thus any move that would put you or any rock outside of the labyrinth is illegal.\n\nCount the number of different legal paths you can take from the start to the goal modulo $10^9 + 7$.

In this problem, we can use dynamic programming to keep track of the number of ways to reach each cell in the labyrinth.

We need to cover the complete graph with cycles of length 3 and 4, ensuring that each edge is in exactly two cycles.\n\n## Tutorial:\nTo solve this problem, we can use the concept of finding cycles in a graph. We can start by creating a complete graph with n vertices. Then, we can use an algorithm to find cycles of length 3 and 4 in the graph. One way to do this is by using the Depth First Search (DFS) algorithm to find cycles in the graph. We can keep track of the vertices visited and the edges traversed to find the cycles.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. Problem: Cycle in Graph\n   - Given an undirected graph, the task is to find if there is a cycle in the graph.\n   - Solution: We can use the DFS algorithm to find a back edge in the graph. If we encounter a back edge during the DFS traversal, it means there is a cycle in the graph.\n   - Python3 code:\n   ```python\n   def hasCycle(graph, v, visited, parent):\n       visited[v] = True\n       for i in graph[v]:\n           if not visited[i]:\n               if hasCycle(graph, i, visited, v):\n                   return True\n           elif parent != i:\n               return True\n       return False\n   ```\n\n2. Problem: Hamiltonian Cycle\n   - Given a graph, the task is to find if there is a Hamiltonian cycle in the graph.\n   - Solution: We can use the backtracking algorithm to find the Hamiltonian cycle in the graph. We start from a vertex and explore all the paths using backtracking, and if we reach the original vertex and have visited all the vertices, then we have found a Hamiltonian cycle.\n   - Python3 code:\n   ```python\n   def hamiltonianCycle(graph, path, pos):\n       if pos == len(graph):\n           if graph[path[pos - 1]][path[0]] == 1:\n               return True\n           else:\n               return False\n       for v in range(1, len(graph)):\n           if isValid(v, graph, path, pos):\n               path[pos] = v\n               if hamiltonianCycle(graph, path, pos + 1):\n                   return True\n               path[pos] = -1\n       return False\n   ```\n\n3. Problem: Eulerian Path\n   - Given a graph, the task is to find if there is an Eulerian path in the graph.\n   - Solution: We can use Fleury's algorithm to find the Eulerian path in the graph. The algorithm starts from an arbitrary vertex and keeps adding edges to the path until there are no more edges left. It ensures that we do not get stuck at any vertex and can traverse all edges.\n   - Python3 code:\n   ```python\n   def fleury(graph):\n       if not isConnected(graph):\n           return False\n       oddCount = 0\n       startVertex = 0\n       for i in range(len(graph)):\n           if degree(graph, i) % 2 != 0:\n               oddCount += 1\n               startVertex = i\n       if oddCount > 2:\n           return False\n       eulerianPath = []\n       eulerianPathUtil(graph, startVertex, eulerianPath)\n       return eulerianPath\n   ```\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n```python\ndef solveMoonProblem(n):\n    if n % 2 == 0:\n        print(-1)\n    else:\n        cycles = []\n        for i in range(1, n):\n            cycles.append([3, i, i+1, i+2])\n            cycles.append([4, i, i+1, i+2, i+3])\n        cycles.append([3, n, 1, 2])\n        cycles.append([4, n, 1, 2, 3])\n        print(len(cycles))\n        for cycle in cycles:\n            print(*cycle)\n\n# Take input\nn = int(input())\n# Call the function and print the output\nsolveMoonProblem(n)\n```"], "prompt_tokens": [567], "completion_tokens": [865], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": false, "language": "Python3", "task_id": 2153}

In order for the processing to be truly of high quality, the application must receive at least k photos with contrasts which differ as little as possible.\n\nEvlampiy already knows the contrast v_{i} for each of his n photos. Now he wants to split the photos into groups, so that each group contains at least k photos. As a result, each photo must belong to exactly one group.\n\nHe considers a processing time of the j-th group to be the difference between the maximum and minimum values of v_{i} in the group. Because of multithreading the processing time of a division into groups is the maximum processing time among all groups.\n\nSplit n photos into groups in a such way that the processing time of the division is the minimum possible, i.e. that the the maximum processing time over all groups as least as possible.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and k (1 \u2264 k \u2264 n \u2264 3\u00b710^5) \u2014 number of photos and minimum size of a group.\n\nThe second line contains n integers v_1, v_2, ..., v_{n} (1 \u2264 v_{i} \u2264 10^9), where v_{i} is the contrast of the i-th photo.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint the minimal processing time of the division into groups.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n5 2\n50 110 130 40 120\n\nOutput\n20\n\nInput\n4 1\n2 3 4 1\n\nOutput\n0\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example the photos should be split into 2 groups: [40, 50] and [110, 120, 130].
