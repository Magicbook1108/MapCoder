{"description": "You are given a string $$$s$$$ consisting of lowercase Latin letters. Let the length of $$$s$$$ be $$$|s|$$$. You may perform several operations on this string.In one operation, you can choose some index $$$i$$$ and remove the $$$i$$$-th character of $$$s$$$ ($$$s_i$$$) if at least one of its adjacent characters is the previous letter in the Latin alphabet for $$$s_i$$$. For example, the previous letter for b is a, the previous letter for s is r, the letter a has no previous letters. Note that after each removal the length of the string decreases by one. So, the index $$$i$$$ should satisfy the condition $$$1 \\le i \\le |s|$$$ during each operation.For the character $$$s_i$$$ adjacent characters are $$$s_{i-1}$$$ and $$$s_{i+1}$$$. The first and the last characters of $$$s$$$ both have only one adjacent character (unless $$$|s| = 1$$$).Consider the following example. Let $$$s=$$$ bacabcab.  During the first move, you can remove the first character $$$s_1=$$$ b because $$$s_2=$$$ a. Then the string becomes $$$s=$$$ acabcab.  During the second move, you can remove the fifth character $$$s_5=$$$ c because $$$s_4=$$$ b. Then the string becomes $$$s=$$$ acabab.

{"description": "The map of Bertown can be represented as a set of $$$n$$$ intersections, numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ and connected by $$$m$$$ one-way roads. It is possible to move along the roads from any intersection to any other intersection. The length of some path from one intersection to another is the number of roads that one has to traverse along the path. The shortest path from one intersection $$$v$$$ to another intersection $$$u$$$ is the path that starts in $$$v$$$, ends in $$$u$$$ and has the minimum length among all such paths.Polycarp lives near the intersection $$$s$$$ and works in a building near the intersection $$$t$$$. Every day he gets from $$$s$$$ to $$$t$$$ by car. Today he has chosen the following path to his workplace: $$$p_1$$$, $$$p_2$$$, ..., $$$p_k$$$, where $$$p_1 = s$$$, $$$p_k = t$$$, and all other elements of this sequence are the intermediate intersections, listed in the order Polycarp arrived at them. Polycarp never arrived at the same intersection twice, so all elements of this sequence are pairwise distinct. Note that you know Polycarp's path beforehand (it is fixed), and it is not necessarily one of the shortest paths from $$$s$$$ to $$$t$$$.Polycarp's car has a complex navigation system installed in it. Let's describe how it works. When Polycarp starts his journey at the intersection $$$s$$$, the system chooses some shortest path from $$$s$$$ to $$$t$$$ and shows it to Polycarp. Let's denote the next intersection in the chosen path as $$$v$$$. If Polycarp chooses to drive along the road from $$$s$$$ to $$$v$$$, then the navigator shows him the same shortest path (obviously, starting from $$$v$$$ as soon as he arrives at this intersection). However, if Polycarp chooses to drive to another intersection $$$w$$$ instead, the navigator rebuilds the path: as soon as Polycarp arrives at $$$w$$$, the navigation system chooses some shortest path from $$$w$$$ to $$$t$$$ and shows it to Polycarp. The same process continues until Polycarp arrives at $$$t$$$: if Polycarp moves along the road recommended by the system, it maintains the shortest path it has already built; but if Polycarp chooses some other path, the system rebuilds the path by the same rules.Here is an example. Suppose the map of Bertown looks as follows, and Polycarp drives along the path $$$[1, 2, 3, 4]$$$ ($$$s = 1$$$, $$$t = 4$$$): Check the picture by the link http://tk.codeforces.com/a.png   When Polycarp starts at $$$1$$$, the system chooses some shortest path from $$$1$$$ to $$$4$$$. There is only one such path, it is $$$[1, 5, 4]$$$;  Polycarp chooses to drive to $$$2$$$, which is not along the path chosen by the system. When Polycarp arrives at $$$2$$$, the navigator rebuilds the path by choosing some shortest path from $$$2$$$ to $$$4$$$, for example, $$$[2, 6, 4]$$$ (note that it could choose $$$[2, 3, 4]$$$);  Polycarp chooses to drive to $$$3$$$, which is not along the path chosen by the system. When Polycarp arrives at $$$3$$$, the navigator rebuilds the path by choosing the only shortest path from $$$3$$$ to $$$4$$$, which is $$$[3, 4]$$$;  Polycarp arrives at $$$4$$$ along the road chosen by the navigator, so the system does not have to rebuild anything. Overall, we get $$$2$$$ rebuilds in this scenario. Note that if the system chose $$$[2, 3, 4]$$$ instead of $$$[2, 6, 4]$$$ during the second step, there would be only $$$1$$$ rebuild (since Polycarp goes along the path, so the system maintains the path $$$[3, 4]$$$ during the third step).The example shows us that the number of rebuilds can differ even if the map of Bertown and the path chosen by Polycarp stays the same. Given this information (the map and Polycarp's path), can you determine the minimum and the maximum number of rebuilds that could have happened during the journey?", "input_from": "standard input", "output_to": "standard output", "time_limit": "2 seconds", "memory_limit": "512 megabytes", "input_spec": "The first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le m \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) \u2014 the number of intersections and one-way roads in Bertown, respectively.

In order to prevent this from happening to future Doctors, Heidi decided to prepare herself by learning some basic hashing techniques.The first hashing function she designed is as follows.Given two positive integers $$$(x, y)$$$ she defines $$$H(x,y):=x^2+2xy+x+1$$$.Now, Heidi wonders if the function is reversible.

We can iterate through the buying opportunities and find the minimum buying price. Then, we can iterate through the selling opportunities and find the maximum selling price. Finally, we can calculate the maximum profit by selling all the shares at the maximum selling price.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. Problem: Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock\n   - Description: You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the i-th day. You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.\n   - Solution: We can use a greedy approach to iterate through the prices and keep track of the minimum buying price and the maximum profit.\n   - Python3 code:\n   ```python\n   def maxProfit(prices):\n       min_price = float('inf')\n       max_profit = 0\n       for price in prices:\n           if price < min_price:\n               min_price = price\n           elif price - min_price > max_profit:\n               max_profit = price - min_price\n       return max_profit\n   ```\n\n2.

You may complete as many transactions as you like (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times) with the following restrictions: After you sell your stock, you cannot buy stock on the next day (i.e., cooldown one day).\n   - Solution: We can use dynamic programming to keep track of the maximum profit with different states (buy, sell, cooldown).\n   - Python3 code:\n   ```python\n   def maxProfit(prices):\n       if not prices:\n           return 0\n       buy, sell, cooldown = -prices[0], 0, 0\n       for price in prices:\n           buy = max(buy, cooldown - price)\n           cooldown = max(cooldown, sell)\n           sell = max(sell, buy + price)\n       return sell\n   ```\n\n3.

You can take as many jobs as you want, but you can only take one job at a time. The end time of one job cannot be earlier than the start time of the other job. Return the maximum profit you can take.\n   - Solution: We can use dynamic programming and binary search to find the maximum profit by considering different job schedules.\n   - Python3 code:\n   ```python\n   def jobScheduling(startTime, endTime, profit):\n       jobs = sorted(zip(startTime, endTime, profit), key=lambda x: x[1])\n       dp = [[0, 0]]\n       for s, e, p in jobs:\n           i = bisect.bisect(dp, [s + 1]) - 1\n           if dp[i][1] + p > dp[-1][1]:\n               dp.append([e, dp[i][1] + p])\n       return dp[-1][1]\n   ```\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n```python\ndef maxProfit(n, m, r, buy_prices, sell_prices):\n    min_buy_price = min(buy_prices)\n    max_sell_price = max(sell_prices)\n    if min_buy_price >= max_sell_price:\n        return r\n    else:\n        shares = r // min_buy_price\n        return r + (shares * (max_sell_price - min_buy_price))\n\n# Take input\nn, m, r = map(int, input().split())\nbuy_prices = list(map(int, input().split()))\nsell_prices = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n# Call the function and print the output\nprint(maxProfit(n, m, r, buy_prices, sell_prices))\n```"], "prompt_tokens": [784], "completion_tokens": [890], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": true, "language": "Python3", "task_id": "42f25d492bddc12d3d89d39315d63cb9"}

{"description": "Hasan loves playing games and has recently discovered a game called TopScore. In this soccer-like game there are $$$p$$$ players doing penalty shoot-outs. Winner is the one who scores the most. In case of ties, one of the top-scorers will be declared as the winner randomly with equal probability.They have just finished the game and now are waiting for the result. But there's a tiny problem! The judges have lost the paper of scores! Fortunately they have calculated sum of the scores before they get lost and also for some of the players they have remembered a lower bound on how much they scored. However, the information about the bounds is private, so Hasan only got to know his bound.According to the available data, he knows that his score is at least $$$r$$$ and sum of the scores is $$$s$$$.Thus the final state of the game can be represented in form of sequence of $$$p$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_p$$$ ($$$0 \\le a_i$$$) \u2014 player's scores. Hasan is player number $$$1$$$, so $$$a_1 \\ge r$$$. Also $$$a_1 + a_2 + \\dots + a_p = s$$$. Two states are considered different if there exists some position $$$i$$$ such that the value of $$$a_i$$$ differs in these states. Once again, Hasan doesn't know the exact scores (he doesn't know his exact score as well). So he considers each of the final states to be equally probable to achieve.Help Hasan find the probability of him winning.It can be shown that it is in the form of $$$\\frac{P}{Q}$$$ where $$$P$$$ and $$$Q$$$ are non-negative integers and $$$Q \\ne 0$$$, $$$P \\le Q$$$.

The idea is to group the visitors in such a way that the total cost is minimized. We can start by counting the number of adults and pupils. Then, we can sort the groups in non-decreasing order of their costs. After that, we can iterate through the groups and assign each visitor to the group with the minimum cost. \n\n## Example Problems:\n1. Problem: Movie Festival\n   - Description: There are n movies to watch, each with a start and end time. The task is to find the maximum number of movies that can be watched without overlapping.\n   - Solution: Sort the movies by their end times, then iterate through the movies and select the next movie whose start time is greater than or equal to the end time of the previous movie.\n   - Python3 code:\n   ```python\n   n = int(input())\n   movies = []\n   for _ in range(n):\n       start, end = map(int, input().split())\n       movies.append((start, end))\n   movies.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])\n   count = 1\n   end_time = movies[0][1]\n   for i in range(1, n):\n       if movies[i][0] >= end_time:\n           count += 1\n           end_time = movies[i][1]\n   print(count)\n   ```\n\n2. Problem: Minimum Cost to Connect Sticks\n   - Description: Given n sticks with their lengths, the task is to connect the sticks into one stick with the minimum cost. The cost of connecting two sticks is equal to the sum of their lengths.\n   - Solution: Use a priority queue to repeatedly select the two sticks with the minimum lengths, connect them, and add the cost to the total cost.\n   - Python3 code:\n   ```python\n   import heapq\n   sticks = [2, 4, 3, 6]\n   heapq.heapify(sticks)\n   total_cost = 0\n   while len(sticks) > 1:\n       first = heapq.heappop(sticks)\n       second = heapq.heappop(sticks)\n       cost = first + second\n       total_cost += cost\n       heapq.heappush(sticks, cost)\n   print(total_cost)\n   ```\n\n3.

We say that this permutation maps value 1 into the value p1, value 2 into the value p2 and so on.Kyota Ootori has just learned about cyclic representation of a permutation. A cycle is a sequence of numbers such that each element of this sequence is being mapped into the next element of this sequence (and the last element of the cycle is being mapped into the first element of the cycle). The cyclic representation is a representation of p as a collection of cycles forming p. For example, permutation p\u2009=\u2009[4,\u20091,\u20096,\u20092,\u20095,\u20093] has a cyclic representation that looks like (142)(36)(5) because 1 is replaced by 4, 4 is replaced by 2, 2 is replaced by 1, 3 and 6 are swapped, and 5 remains in place. Permutation may have several cyclic representations, so Kyoya defines the standard cyclic representation of a permutation as follows. First, reorder the elements within each cycle so the largest element is first. Then, reorder all of the cycles so they are sorted by their first element. For our example above, the standard cyclic representation of [4,\u20091,\u20096,\u20092,\u20095,\u20093] is (421)(5)(63).Now, Kyoya notices that if we drop the parenthesis in the standard cyclic representation, we get another permutation! For instance, [4,\u20091,\u20096,\u20092,\u20095,\u20093] will become [4,\u20092,\u20091,\u20095,\u20096,\u20093].Kyoya notices that some permutations don't change after applying operation described above at all. He wrote all permutations of length n that do not change in a list in lexicographic order. Unfortunately, his friend Tamaki Suoh lost this list.

If the nim-sum of the pile sizes is non-zero, then the first player wins, otherwise, the second player wins.\n   - Python3 code:\n   ```python\n   def nimGame(piles):\n       nim_sum = 0\n       for pile in piles:\n           nim_sum ^= pile\n       return \"First\" if nim_sum != 0 else \"Second\"\n   ```\n\n2. Problem: Coin Game\n   - In this game, there are n coins in a line, each with a value. Two players take turns to take either the first or last coin from the line, and the player with the maximum total value of coins wins. Determine the winning player based on the optimal strategy for both players.\n   - Solution: We can use dynamic programming to determine the maximum value that can be obtained by each player. Then, based on the optimal strategy, we can determine the winning player.\n   - Python3 code:\n   ```python\n   def coinGame(coins):\n       n = len(coins)\n       dp = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]\n       for i in range(n):\n           dp[i][i] = coins[i]\n       for length in range(2, n+1):\n           for i in range(n-length+1):\n               j = i + length - 1\n               dp[i][j] = max(coins[i] - dp[i+1][j], coins[j] - dp[i][j-1])\n       return \"First\" if dp[0][n-1] > 0 else \"Second\"\n   ```\n\n3.

When both rows are done they move one row forward: the first attendant serves row 2 while the second attendant serves row 4.

{"description": "For his computer science class, Jacob builds a model tree with sticks and balls containing n nodes in the shape of a tree. Jacob has spent ai minutes building the i-th ball in the tree.Jacob's teacher will evaluate his model and grade Jacob based on the effort he has put in.

What could be better for high quality identification?But not everything is so simple. The pictures from camera appear rotated too (on clockwise camera rotation frame the content becomes rotated counter-clockwise). But the identification algorithm can work only with faces that are just slightly deviated from vertical.Vasya was entrusted to correct the situation \u2014 to rotate a captured image so that image would be minimally deviated from vertical. Requirements were severe. Firstly, the picture should be rotated only on angle divisible by 90 degrees to not lose a bit of information about the image. Secondly, the frames from the camera are so huge and FPS is so big that adequate rotation speed is provided by hardware FPGA solution only. And this solution can rotate only by 90 degrees clockwise. Of course, one can apply 90 degrees turn several times but for the sake of performance the number of turns should be minimized.Help Vasya implement the program that by the given rotation angle of the camera can determine the minimum number of 90 degrees clockwise turns necessary to get a picture in which up direction deviation from vertical is minimum.The next figure contains frames taken from an unrotated camera, then from rotated 90 degrees clockwise, then from rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise.

The honest people are going to say the correct answer, the liars are going to say any integer from 1 to n, which is not the correct answer. Every liar chooses his answer, regardless of the other liars, so two distinct liars may give distinct answer.Serge does not know any information about the people besides their answers to his question.

Problem: Watering Plants\n   - Description: Given a garden with n plants and a watering system with k sprinklers, each with a certain range, determine the minimum number of sprinklers needed to water all the plants or determine if it's impossible.\n   - Solution: We can use the greedy algorithm to place the sprinklers in such a way that we cover the maximum number of plants with each sprinkler, minimizing the total number of sprinklers used.\n   - Python3 code:\n   ```python\n   def minSprinklers(plants, ranges):\n       n = len(plants)\n       sprinklers = [0] * n\n       for i in range(n):\n           if plants[i] > 0:\n               for j in range(max(0, i - ranges[i]), min(n, i + ranges[i] + 1)):\n                   sprinklers[j] = max(sprinklers[j], i + ranges[i])\n       count, right = 0, 0\n       for i in range(n):\n           if i > right:\n               return -1\n           if i == right:\n               count += 1\n               right = max(sprinklers[i], right)\n       return count\n   ```\n\n2. Problem: Gas Station\n   - Description: Given an array of gas stations and the amount of gas available at each station, determine the minimum number of gas stations needed to complete a circular route or determine if it's impossible.\n   - Solution: We can use the greedy algorithm to find the starting point from where we can complete the circular route by refueling at each gas station.\n   - Python3 code:\n   ```python\n   def canCompleteCircuit(gas, cost):\n       total_gas, curr_gas, start = 0, 0, 0\n       for i in range(len(gas)):\n           total_gas += gas[i] - cost[i]\n           curr_gas += gas[i] - cost[i]\n           if curr_gas < 0:\n               start = i + 1\n               curr_gas = 0\n       return start if total_gas >= 0 else -1\n   ```\n\n3. Problem: Task Scheduling\n   - Description: Given a list of tasks with their start and end times, determine the minimum number of machines needed to schedule all the tasks or determine if it's impossible.\n   - Solution: We can use the greedy algorithm to schedule the tasks in such a way that we minimize the number of machines used.\n   - Python3 code:\n   ```python\n   def minMachines(tasks):\n       tasks.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])\n       machines = [tasks[0][1]]\n       for task in tasks[1:]:\n           allocated = False\n           for i in range(len(machines)):\n               if machines[i] <= task[0]:\n                   machines[i] = task[1]\n                   allocated = True\n                   break\n           if not allocated:\n               machines.append(task[1])\n       return len(machines)\n   ```\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n- Explanation of the solution: \n  - We can use the greedy algorithm to solve the problem. We start with the largest splitter and connect it to the water pipe. Then, we continue to connect the next largest splitter to the output pipes of the previous splitters until we have the required number of pipes with flowing water. If at any point we are unable to connect the required number of pipes, we determine that it's impossible to build the pipeline with the given splitters.\n\n- Python3 code:\n```python\ndef minSplitters(n, k):\n    if n == 1:\n        return 0\n    if k < 2:\n        return -1\n    if n <= k:\n        return 1\n    low, high = 2, k\n    while low <= high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        total_pipes = mid * (mid + 1) // 2\n        if total_pipes - mid >= n:\n            high = mid - 1\n        else:\n            low = mid + 1\n    return k - high\n\n# Take input\nn, k = map(int, input().split())\n\n# Call the function and print the output\nprint(minSplitters(n, k))\n```"], "prompt_tokens": [656], "completion_tokens": [1090], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": false, "language": "Python3", "task_id": "83bcfe32db302fbae18e8a95d89cf411"}

He's been working there for a long time and is satisfied with his job, as it allows him to eat out in the best restaurants and order the most expensive and exotic wood types there. The content special agent has got an important task: to get the latest research by British scientists on the English Language. These developments are encoded and stored in a large safe. The Beaver's teeth are strong enough, so the authorities assured that upon arriving at the place the beaver won't have any problems with opening the safe.And he finishes his aspen sprig and leaves for this important task. Of course, the Beaver arrived at the location without any problems, but alas. He can't open the safe with his strong and big teeth. At this point, the Smart Beaver get a call from the headquarters and learns that opening the safe with the teeth is not necessary, as a reliable source has sent the following information: the safe code consists of digits and has no leading zeroes. There also is a special hint, which can be used to open the safe. The hint is string s with the following structure:  if si = \"?\", then the digit that goes i-th in the safe code can be anything (between 0 to 9, inclusively);  if si is a digit (between 0 to 9, inclusively), then it means that there is digit si on position i in code;  if the string contains letters from \"A\" to \"J\", then all positions with the same letters must contain the same digits and the positions with distinct letters must contain distinct digits.  The length of the safe code coincides with the length of the hint. For example, hint \"?JGJ9\" has such matching safe code variants: \"51919\", \"55959\", \"12329\", \"93539\" and so on, and has wrong variants such as: \"56669\", \"00111\", \"03539\" and \"13666\".After receiving such information, the authorities change the plan and ask the special agents to work quietly and gently and not to try to open the safe by mechanical means, and try to find the password using the given hint.At a special agent school the Smart Beaver was the fastest in his platoon finding codes for such safes, but now he is not in that shape: the years take their toll ... Help him to determine the number of possible variants of the code to the safe, matching the given hint.

He's trying to handle his shoes carefully so that each pair stood side by side. But by the end of the week because of his very active lifestyle in his dressing room becomes a mess.Smart Beaver from ABBYY is not only the brightest beaver in the area, but he also is the most domestically oriented. For example, on Mondays the Smart Beaver cleans everything in his home.It's Monday morning. Smart Beaver does not want to spend the whole day cleaning, besides, there is much in to do and it\u2019s the gym day, so he wants to clean up as soon as possible. Now the floors are washed, the dust is wiped off \u2014 it\u2019s time to clean up in the dressing room.

If it does, we pop the top of the stack, otherwise the string is not valid.\n   - Python3 code:\n   ```python\n   def isValid(s: str) -> bool:\n       stack = []\n       mapping = {\")\": \"(\", \"}\": \"{\", \"]\": \"[\"}\n       for char in s:\n           if char in mapping:\n               top_element = stack.pop() if stack else '#'\n               if mapping[char] != top_element:\n                   return False\n           else:\n               stack.append(char)\n       return not stack\n   ```\n\n2. Problem: Maximum Nesting Depth of the Parentheses\n   - Given a valid parentheses string s, the nesting depth of s is the maximum number of layers of parentheses within the string.\n   - Solution: We can iterate through the string and keep track of the maximum nesting depth by counting the number of open brackets and updating the maximum depth accordingly.\n   - Python3 code:\n   ```python\n   def maxDepth(s: str) -> int:\n       max_depth = 0\n       current_depth = 0\n       for char in s:\n           if char == '(':\n               current_depth += 1\n               max_depth = max(max_depth, current_depth)\n           elif char == ')':\n               current_depth -= 1\n       return max_depth\n   ```\n\n3. Problem: Minimum Add to Make Parentheses Valid\n   - Given a string S of '(' and ')' parentheses, we add the minimum number of parentheses ( '(' or ')', and in any positions ) so that the resulting parentheses string is valid.\n   - Solution: We can use a stack to keep track of the open brackets and their corresponding close brackets. Then, we can count the number of unmatched brackets and return the count as the minimum number of parentheses to add.\n   - Python3 code:\n   ```python\n   def minAddToMakeValid(S: str) -> int:\n       stack = []\n       count = 0\n       for char in S:\n           if char == '(':\n               stack.append(char)\n           elif char == ')':\n               if stack:\n                   stack.pop()\n               else:\n                   count += 1\n       return count + len(stack)\n   ```\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n```python\ndef minInkRequired(nm: str, a: str, b: str) -> int:\n    n, m = map(int, nm.split())\n    a = list(map(int, a.split()))\n    b = list(map(int, b.split()))\n    \n    stack = []\n    total_ink = 0\n    \n    for i in range(n * m):\n        if i % n == 0:\n            if a[0] < b[0]:\n                total_ink += a[0]\n                stack.append(0)\n            else:\n                total_ink += b[0]\n                stack.append(1)\n        else:\n            if stack[-1] == 0:\n                if a[i % n] < b[i % n]:\n                    total_ink += a[i % n]\n                    stack.append(i % n)\n                else:\n                    total_ink += b[i % n]\n                    stack.append(i % n + 1)\n            else:\n                if a[i % n] < b[i % n]:\n                    total_ink += a[i % n]\n                    stack.append(i % n)\n                else:\n                    total_ink += b[i % n]\n                    stack.append(i % n + 1)\n    \n    return total_ink\n\n# Test the function with the sample inputs\nprint(minInkRequired('2 6', '1 2', '2 1'))  # Output: 12\nprint(minInkRequired('1 10000000', '2', '3'))  # Output: 25000000\n```"], "prompt_tokens": [593], "completion_tokens": [1008], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": false, "language": "Python3", "task_id": "f40900973f4ebeb6fdafd75ebe4e9601"}

Problem: Subsequence\n   - Description: Given a string s, determine if it is a subsequence of the word \"hello\".\n   - Solution: We can iterate through the word \"hello\" and keep track of the current letter we are looking for. If we find all the letters in the correct order, then the given string is a subsequence of \"hello\".\n   - Python3 code:\n   ```python\n   def isSubsequence(s):\n       target = \"hello\"\n       i = 0\n       for char in s:\n           if char == target[i]:\n               i += 1\n               if i == 5:\n                   return \"YES\"\n       return \"NO\"\n   ```\n\n2. Problem: Chat Room\n   - Description: Given a string s, determine if it is possible to form the word \"hello\" by deleting some letters from s.\n   - Solution: We can use the same approach as in the original problem to check if the given word contains the letters in the order of \"h\", \"e\", \"l\", \"l\", \"o\".\n   - Python3 code:\n   ```python\n   def chatRoom(s):\n       i = 0\n       for char in s:\n           if char == \"h\" and i == 0:\n               i += 1\n           elif char == \"e\" and i == 1:\n               i += 1\n           elif char == \"l\" and i == 2:\n               i += 1\n           elif char == \"l\" and i == 3:\n               i += 1\n           elif char == \"o\" and i == 4:\n               return \"YES\"\n       return \"NO\"\n   ```\n\n3. Problem: Hello, Hello!\n   - Description: Given a string s, determine the number of times the word \"hello\" can be formed by deleting some letters from s.\n   - Solution: We can use a sliding window approach to count the number of times the word \"hello\" can be formed by deleting some letters from s.\n   - Python3 code:\n   ```python\n   def helloHello(s):\n       count = 0\n       i = 0\n       for char in s:\n           if char == \"h\" and i == 0:\n               i += 1\n           elif char == \"e\" and i == 1:\n               i += 1\n           elif char == \"l\" and i == 2:\n               i += 1\n           elif char == \"l\" and i == 3:\n               i += 1\n           elif char == \"o\" and i == 4:\n               count += 1\n               i = 0\n       return count\n   ```\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n- Explanation of the solution: We iterate through the given word and keep track of the current letter we are looking for. If we find all the letters in the correct order, then Vasya managed to say hello.\n- Python3 code:\n```python\ndef sayHello(s):\n    i = 0\n    for char in s:\n        if char == \"h\" and i == 0:\n            i += 1\n        elif char == \"e\" and i == 1:\n            i += 1\n        elif char == \"l\" and i == 2:\n            i += 1\n        elif char == \"l\" and i == 3:\n            i += 1\n        elif char == \"o\" and i == 4:\n            return \"YES\"\n    return \"NO\"\n\n# Take input from standard input\nword = input().strip()\n\n# Call the function and print the output\nprint(sayHello(word))\n```"], "prompt_tokens": [469], "completion_tokens": [967], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": true, "language": "Python3", "task_id": "c5d19dc8f2478ee8d9cba8cc2e4cd838"}

It is known that a proper email address contains only such symbols as . @ and lower-case Latin letters, doesn't start with and doesn't end with a dot.

You have to carry out a series of replacements so that the length of the result was as short as possible and it was a proper email address.

We can iterate through the input string and replace \"dot\" with \".\", and \"at\" with \"@\". Then we can check if the resulting email address is valid and lexicographically minimal. If not, we can make further replacements to achieve the desired result.\n\n## Example Problems:\n1. Problem: Shortest Palindrome\n   - Description: Given a string s, you can convert it to a palindrome by adding characters in front of it. Find and return the shortest palindrome you can find by performing this transformation.\n   - Solution: We can use the KMP algorithm to find the longest prefix of the input string that is also a suffix.

Problem: Lexicographically Minimal String\n   - Description: Given a string s, find the lexicographically minimal string that can be obtained by removing exactly one character from s.\n   - Solution: We can iterate through the string and find the first occurrence of a character that is greater than the next character. Then we can remove that character to form the lexicographically minimal string.\n   - Python3 code:\n   ```python\n   def minRemoveToMakeValid(s: str) -> str:\n       stack = []\n       to_remove = set()\n       for i, char in enumerate(s):\n           if char == '(':\n               stack.append(i)\n           elif char == ')':\n               if stack:\n                   stack.pop()\n               else:\n                   to_remove.add(i)\n       to_remove = to_remove.union(set(stack))\n       return ''.join([s[i] for i in range(len(s)) if i not in to_remove])\n   ```\n\n3.
